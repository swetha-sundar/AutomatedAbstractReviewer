The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of proton beam radiation therapy as an alternative to exenteration. METHODS: Twenty patients with extended conjunctival melanoma were treated by proton beam irradiation. Most cases were T3 tumours which were not accessible to brachytherapy due to their extension, localisation with fornical or caruncular involvement. Only 2 patients had a tumour limited to the bulbar conjunctiva. Both were recurrent tumours with multiple lesions. Sixteen cases were recurrences after various pre-treatments. The area of the conjunctiva which was suspected to have microscopic disease was treated by 31 Gy in 6 fractions. The "high risk" areas with a clinically detectable tumour (primary target volume) were treated by an additional boost using a smaller beam size and applying 2 fractions up to 45 Gy. An individually shaped compensator was brought into the beam to modify the range of the protons so that the eye was irradiated only at a depth of 2 mm. RESULTS: The mean follow-up time was 38.1+/-26.6 months (median 34 months). Recurrent disease occurred in 6 cases (30%); 2 of them outside the irradiated volume, 3 within the target volume treated by 31 Gy, and just one in the primary target volume treated by 45 Gy. An exenteration followed only in two patients (10%). 6 patients (30%) suffered from metastatic disease and 4 (20%) of them have died by now. During follow up we found no statistically significant association between the occurrence of local recurrence after proton radiotherapy and the development of metastases. Best corrected visual acuity remained stable in 12 cases (60%); in 14 patients the best corrected visual acuity was 0.25 or better. A sicca-syndrome developed in 19/20 patients. However, only 10/20 patients used artificial tears more than 5x/d. A focal cataract developed in 7 patients (35%). There was eyelash loss in the area of irradiated eyelids. In 4 cases a limbal stem cell deficiency occurred with the consequence of corneal vascularisation. CONCLUSIONS: Proton radiotherapy may serve as an alternative to exenteration in case of T3 and diffuse T1 or T2 conjunctival melanomas

A limited institutional pilot study was therefore done by the Southwest Oncology Group between October 1977, and November 1978 to test the benefit of this program in previously untreated persons with Stages 3 and 4 diffuse histology non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Eleven evaluable patients with the following histologies were treated: 7 poorly differentiated, 2 with histiocytic, 1 with mixed lymphoma and 1 with well-differentiated morphology. CHOP was given in the following manner: cyclophosphamide 400 mg/M2 IV day 1, adriamycin 40 mg/M2 IV day 1, vincristine 2 mg IV day 1, and Prednisone 100 mg po daily X 5. Forty-five rad total body irradiation was delivered in three fractions on days 21, 23 and 25. Chemotherapy was repeated on day 42, etc., until four cycles of CHOP and three cycles TBI (135R) were delivered. Responses were seen in 8/11 patients (6 CR and 2 PR); 5 persons are currently alive and 6 are dead. Two of the living patients are alive with disease and the remainder are in unmaintained remission. Two persons died with no response and one died in complete remission of an unrelated illness. The median duration of remission is 15 months and the median survival for all patients is 48 months. The therapy was well tolerated with a mean nadir leukocyte count of 3,020 X 10(9)/microliters (range 1.2-5.5) and a mean nadir platelet count of 188 X 10(9)/microliters (range 016-270). As delivered, this program is capable of producing durable remissions and needs to be verified in a larger series of patients

Eleven patients were initially treated with x-ray at doses of 16.2-50.4 (mean 42.5) Gy, followed by proton beam at doses of 30.0-52.9 (mean 37.6) Gy. The other four patients were treated with proton beams alone at total doses of 75.0-88.5 (mean 81.4) Gy. The mean total dose for the 15 patients was 80.4 Gy. As a result, the primary tumor lesions of all 15 patients disappeared and complete responses were obtained. Approximately four to five months later, nine of the 15 patients developed esophageal ulcer formations at the circumferences of their primary lesions. The ulcerations were healed, however, by conservative management. There was no evidence of local recurrence throughout the observations on six cases of superficial carcinoma. Among nine advanced carcinoma patients, three relapsed into esophageal carcinoma. Recurrences were observed eight, 16 and 44 months, respectively, after the treatment. Ten of the 15 patients died, but eight died of other diseases. Three of four cases at autopsy did not show any cancer cells in irradiated primary lesions. Four of the 15 patients lived for over five years. The results suggest that a high dose of irradiation delivered by a well-defined proton field could result in improved local control and long-term survival in esophageal carcinoma without undue risk of injury to primary and adjacent organs	
1	3619	Is machine energy (4-8 MV) associated with outcome for stage I-II breast cancer patients?	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Boston, Breast, Breast Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Breast Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Breast Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Combined Modality Therapy, Feasibility Studies, Female, Humans, Incidence, Methods, Middle Aged, Multivariate Analysis, Necrosis, Neoplasm Staging, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiation Pneumonitis, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy/ae [Adverse Effects], Recurrence, Risk, Skin, Survivors, Time, Treatment Failure, Treatment Outcome	PURPOSE: To assess the relationship between machine energy (4-8 MV) and treatment outcome in patients treated with conservative surgery and radiation therapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1968 and 1985, 1624 patients were treated for clinical Stage I or II invasive breast cancer. The study population was limited to 1380 patients who underwent complete gross excision and received greater than or equal to 60 Gy to the tumor bed. Of these, 1125 were treated on a 4 MV, 153 on a 6 MV, and 102 on an 8 MV linear accelerator. Patients were selected for treatment on the 8 MV machine based on chest wall separations greater than 24 cm. Of patients treated on the 8 MV, netting was used for 42% and bolus was used for 26%. The median dose with bolus was 14 Gy in seven fractions (range: 2-34.2 Gy). Patients treated on the 8 MV accelerator were older, had a higher percentage of clinical T2 tumors, a higher percentage of pathologically positive nodes, and a lower incidence of extensive intraductal component (EIC). Median follow-up times were 130, 153, and 102 months, respectively, for survivors treated on the 4, 6, and 8 MV machines. RESULTS: We analyzed the site and 5-year crude incidence of first failure by machine energy and found the pattern of first failure site (local, nodal, or distant) to be virtually identical for each energy group. Of the local failures, 12 were in the skin of the treated breast, and these failures were evenly distributed by machine energy. We performed a multivariate analysis to adjust for factors known to predict for treatment failure. When adjusted for these other variables, machine energy was not associated with an increased (or decreased) risk of recurrence (RR for 8 MV vs. 4 MV = 0.94, p = 0.7; RR for 6 MV vs. 4 MV = 1.0, p = 0.9). We also analyzed the nature and incidence of treatment complications (rib fracture, radiation pneumonitis, soft tissue necrosis, and brachial plexopathy) and found no significant differences among the three treatment groups when stratified by treatment technique (tangents only vs. three-field). There was also no significant difference in cosmetic outcome at 5 years among the three groups. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that machine energy over the range of 4 to 8 MV does not significantly affect treatment outcome. Specifically, it was feasible to treat patients with large chest wall separations using an 8 MV machine without an increase in skin recurrences and with the improved dose homogeneity afforded by 8 MV machines as compared with those of lower energies	
1	1509	Association of rectal toxicity with thermal dose parameters in treatment of locally advanced prostate cancer with radiation and hyperthermia	Boston, Confidence Intervals, Digestive System/pa [Pathology], Digestive System/re [Radiation Effects], Heat, Humans, Hyperthermia,Induced, Male, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Prostatic Neoplasms/th [Therapy], Protons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy,Conformal, Rectum/pa [Pathology], Rectum/re [Radiation Effects], Research, Temperature, Time Factors	PURPOSE: Although hyperthermia has been used for more than two decades in the treatment of pelvic tumors, little is known about the potential impact of heat on rectal toxicity when combined with other treatment modalities. Because rectal toxicity is a concern with radiation and may be exacerbated by hyperthermia, definition of the association of thermal dose parameters with rectal toxicity is important. In this report, we correlate rectal toxicity with thermal dose parameters for patients treated with hyperthermia and radiation for prostate cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty patients with T2b-T3b disease (1992 American Joint Committee On Cancer criteria) enrolled in a Phase II study of external beam radiation +/- androgen-suppressive therapy with two transrectal ultrasound hyperthermia treatments were assessed for rectal toxicity. Prostatic and anterior rectal wall temperatures were monitored for all treatments. Rectal wall temperatures were limited to 40 degrees C in 19 patients, 41 degrees C in 3 patients, and 42 degrees C in 8 patients. Logistic regression was used to estimate the log hazard of developing National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria Grade 2 toxicity based on temperature parameters. The following were calculated: hazard ratios, 95% confidence intervals, p values for statistical significance of each parameter, and proportion of variability explained for each parameter. RESULTS: Gastrointestinal toxicity was limited to Grade 2. The rate of acute Grade 2 proctitis was greater for patients with an allowable rectal wall temperature of >40 degrees C. In this group, 7 of 11 patients experienced acute Grade 2 proctitis, as opposed to 3 of 19 patients in the group with rectal wall temperatures limited to 40 degrees C (p = 0.004). Preliminary assessment of long-term toxicity revealed no differences in toxicity. Hazard ratios for acute Grade 2 proctitis for allowable rectal wall temperature, average rectal wall Tmax, and average prostate Tmax were 9.33 (p = 0.01), 3.66 (p = 0.03), and 2.29 (p = 0.08), respectively. A model combining these three parameters explained 48.6% of the variability among groups. CONCLUSION: Rectal toxicity correlates with maximum allowable rectal wall temperature, average rectal wall Tmax, and average prostate Tmax for patients undergoing transrectal ultrasound hyperthermia combined with radiation for treatment of advanced clinically localized prostate cancer. Further definition of this association of thermal dose parameters with rectal toxicity in treatment of pelvic malignancies with hyperthermia should advance the goal of delivering thermal therapy in an effective yet safe manner

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between January 2001 and February 2006, 59 patients with locally advanced or unfavorably located choroidal melanoma were enrolled in a Phase I/II clinical trial of carbon-ion radiotherapy at the National Institute of Radiologic Sciences. The primary endpoint of this study was normal tissue morbidity, and secondary endpoints were local tumor control and patient survival. Of the 59 subjects enrolled, 57 were followed >6 months and analyzed. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients (40%) developed neovascular glaucoma, and three underwent enucleation for eye pain due to elevated intraocular pressure. Incidence of neovascular glaucoma was dependent on tumor size and site. Five patients had died at analysis, three of distant metastasis and two of concurrent disease. All but one patient, who developed marginal recurrence, were controlled locally. Six patients developed distant metastasis, five in the liver and one in the lung. Three-year overall survival, disease-free survival, and local control rates were 88.2%, 84.8%, and 97.4%, respectively. No apparent dose-response relationship was observed in either tumor control or normal tissue morbidity at the dose range applied. CONCLUSION: Carbon-ion radiotherapy can be applied to choroidal melanoma with an acceptable morbidity and sufficient antitumor effect, even with tumors of unfavorable size or site

In extended tumours, ocular surface problems can result after therapy. In this study we examined ocular surface integrity of ten patients who underwent proton beam radiation between 1996 and 2002. METHODS: The patients were examined during their follow-up. Eight of the ten cases who underwent proton radiotherapy were recurrent tumours, which were previously treated with other adjuvant therapies. We performed a standard ophthalmological examination and detailed tear film diagnostics. RESULTS: The follow-up was 17-87 months (mean: 40.9+/-20.1). In six cases more than 50% of the upper and lower eyelids were included in the radiation field. All of these cases showed moderate to severe sicca symptoms. The impression cytology revealed squamous metaplasia of conjunctival cells in nine of ten cases. CONCLUSIONS: Squamous metaplasia of conjunctival epithelia indicates a radiogenic, persisting disturbance of differentiation of the conjunctival epithelial cells. The tear film instability correlates with the loss of mucin-secreting goblet cells and meibomian gland dysfunction

OBJECTIVE: To examine a large clinical series of patients with intraocular melanoma to determine if light irises are associated with increased risk of death from these tumors. METHODS: A total of 1162 patients treated with proton irradiation between 1984 and 1996 were observed through 1997. RESULTS: Iris color in the patients was blue or gray in 48%, green or hazel in 30%, and brown in 23%. Tumors in patients with blue or gray irises were less heavily pigmented (P<.001) and closer to the optic disc and macula (P<.001). Five- and 10-year metastasis-related death rates were 0.14 and 0.21, respectively, for those with blue or gray irises and 0.10 and 0.15, respectively, for those with darker irises (P = .02). In a Cox proportional hazards regression controlling for tumor characteristics, patients with blue or gray irises died of metastatic disease at a rate 1.90 times (95% confidence interval, 1.26-2.85) that of patients with brown irises. The rate of metastatic death was not significantly elevated for those with green or hazel irises (relative risk, 1.43; 95% confidence interval, 0.91-2.23). CONCLUSION: Patients with blue or gray irises appear to be at increased risk of metastatic death from choroidal melanoma, independent of other risk factors

Thirteen patients had carcinomas and three had sarcomas. All patients had complete pelvic surgery including extrafascial (or modified radical) hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, pelvic node sampling, evaluation of peritoneal cytology, and resection of extrauterine metastases when indicated. All patients were free of gross visible tumor after surgery. Target doses of radiation were 3000 cGy to the upper abdomen and 4500 cGy to the pelvis. Median follow-up was 24 months for survivors (range, 17 to 63 months). The disease-free survival and overall survival at 17 months was 50%. Six of the 16 (38%) patients suffered intraabdominal relapse. One patient had a significant complication (bowel perforation). The data from this pilot study suggest that whole abdominal-pelvic irradiation may be useful only in the management of some patients with few high risk features of endometrial carcinoma. Patients with extensive extra-uterine involvement and with sarcoma histology do not appear to benefit from this experimental therapy

Local tumor control and long-term palliation for both primary and metastatic tumors may be achieved with IMRT while reducing the risk of spinal cord toxicity associated with conventional radiotherapy techniques. In this article, we report our initial clinical experience in treating 16 paraspinal tumors with IMRT in which the planning target volume was 2 mm or greater from the spinal cord. METHODS: IMRT was administered by using a linear accelerator mounted with a multileaf collimator. Two immobilization body frames developed at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center were used for patients with and without spinal implants. During a 30-month period, 16 patients underwent IMRT for metastatic and primary tumors. Eleven patients were treated for symptomatic recurrences after undergoing surgery and prior external beam radiotherapy, and one patient was treated after undergoing radiotherapy for a metastatic pancreatic gastrinoma with overlapping ports to the spine. Four patients with primary tumors were treated after primary resection that resulted in positive histological margins. Twelve patients were symptomatic with pain, functional radiculopathy, or both. Tumoral doses were determined on the basis of the relative radiosensitivity of tumors. Patients with metastatic tumors were administered a median tumoral dose of 20 Gy in four to five fractions and a spinal cord maximum dose of 6.0 Gy in addition to the full tolerance dose administered in previous radiation treatments. The primary tumors were delivered a median dose of 70 Gy in 33 to 37 fractions and a spinal cord maximum dose of 16 Gy. The median tumoral volume was 7.8 cm(3). RESULTS: Of the 15 patients who underwent radiographic follow-up, 13 demonstrated either no interval growth or a reduction in tumor size in a median follow-up period of 12 months (range, 2-23 mo). Two patients, one with a thoracic chondrosarcoma and one with a chordoma, showed tumor progression 1 year after undergoing IMRT. Pain symptoms improved in 11 of 11 patients, and 4 of 4 patients had significant improvement in their functionally significant radiculopathy and/or plexopathy. Pain relief was durable in all patients except the two with tumor progression. No patient showed signs or symptoms of radiation-induced myelopathy, radiculopathy, or plexopathy, including 12 patients with a median follow-up of 18 months. CONCLUSION: IMRT was effective for treating pain and improving functional radiculopathy in patients with metastatic and primary tumors. Although long-term tumor control is not established in this study, high-dose tumoral irradiation can be performed without causing radiation myelopathy in more than 1 year of follow-up	
0	2763	Stereotactic single high dose radiation therapy of benign intracranial meningiomas	Adult, Aged, Brain, Female, Humans, Male, Meningeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Meningioma/rt [Radiotherapy], Methods, Middle Aged, Necrosis, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiosurgery, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Recurrence, Research, Stereotaxic Techniques, Time, Tungsten, Universities	Seventeen patients with intracranial meningiomas were treated with single high dose irradiation at the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg. Indications for radiosurgery included unresected tumors, gross disease remaining despite surgery, and recurrences. Therapy was carried out by a technique using multiple non-coplanar arc irradiations from a 15 MeV linear accelerator. This technique coupled with secondary tungsten collimators allowed a high concentration of the dose in the target volume with an extremely steep dose gradient at the field borders. The patients were treated with a single irradiation dose ranging from 10 to 50 Gy (mean of 29 Gy). Four of 17 patients died: one death was tumor-related and not attributable to the treatment, one died of a treatment related complication, and two patients died of intercurrent diseases. The remaining 13 of the 17 patients with a median follow-up time of 40 months have no evidence of tumor relapse. Late severe side effects include five patients with a large area of brain edema, three of which were concurred with tumor necrosis. We conclude from these initial data that single high doses of irradiation concentrated to the tumor volume by stereotaxic methods can achieve local tumor control. It is also clear from these data that the effective therapeutic dose range must be better defined

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1981 and 1988, 15 patients with craniopharyngioma were treated in part or entirely with fractionated 160 MeV proton beam therapy. The group consisted of 5 children (median age, 15.9 years) and 10 adults (median age, 36.2 years). Median dose prescribed to the tumor was 56.9 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE; 1 proton Gray = 1.1 CGE). The median proton component was 26.9 CGE. Patients were treated after documented recurrence after initial surgery (n = 6) or after subtotal resection or biopsy (n = 9). None had had prior radiation therapy. RESULTS: Median observation period of surviving patients (n = 11) was 13.1 years from radiotherapy. One patient was lost to follow-up with tumor control after 5.2 years. Actuarial 10-year survival rate was 72%. Four patients have died 5-9.1 years after treatment, two from local failure. Actuarial 5- and 10-year local control rates were 93% and 85%, respectively. The functional status of the living adult patients is unaltered from their preradiotherapy status; all of them continued leading normal or near normal working lives. None of the patients treated as a child had experienced recurrence of tumor. One child shows learning difficulties and slight retardation, comparable to his preradiotherapy status. The others have professional achievements within the normal range. CONCLUSION: Results in terms of survival and local control are comparable with other contemporary series. Although no formal neuropsychological testing was performed, the surrogate measures of lifestyle and professional accomplishments appear to be satisfactory

The estimation of absorbed dose and optimization of treatment dose based on the pharmacokinetics of BPA in melanoma patients is described. The doses of gamma-rays were measured using small TLDs of Mg2SiO4 (Tb) and thermal neutron fluence was measured using gold foil and wire. The total absorbed dose to the tissue from BNCT was obtained by summing the primary and capture gamma-ray doses and the high LET radiation doses from 10B(n, alpha)7Li and 14N(n,p)14C reactions. The key point of the dose optimization is that the skin surrounding the tumour is always irradiated to 18 Gy-Eq, which is the maximum tolerable dose to the skin, regardless of the 10B-concentration in the tumor. The neutron fluence was optimized as follows. (1) The 10B concentration in the blood was measured 15-40 min after the start of neutron irradiation. (2) The 10B-concentration in the skin was estimated by multiplying the blood 10B value by a factor of 1.3. (3) The neutron fluence was calculated. Absorbed doses to the skin ranged from 15.7 to 37.1 Gy-Eq. Among the patients, 16 out of 22 patients exhibited tolerable skin damage. Although six patients showed skin damage that exceeded the tolerance level, three of them could be cured within a few months after BNCT and the remaining three developed severe skin damage requiring skin grafts. The absorbed doses to the tumor ranged from 15.7 to 68.5 Gy-Eq and the percentage of complete response was 73% (16/22).

The time of development of acute skin reactions varied in 2 patients with 30 metastatic skin nodules treated with doses varying from 1,175 to 1,951 peak pions and 2,350 to 3,901 rads of 100 kVp x rays. The reactions reached their peak approximately one week apart at all dose levels with both forms of radiation. No untoward effects have been seen in epidermis or subcutaneous tissues as late as 169 days after the start of treatment. All nodules disappeared and have not returned 169 days after treatment. There is a strong suggestion that the response of thick tumors is sensitive to the proportion of high LET radiation deposited at various levels in the tumor

METHODS: Sixteen patients, aged 7-34 years, were treated with proton-beam radiation. All had undergone at least one tumor resection. Seven patients underwent repeat resection for recurrence; one had previous x-ray radiotherapy. A daily dose of 1.8 cobalt gray equivalent was used to give a total dose in the range of 50.4-59.4 cobalt gray equivalent. RESULTS: Local control was achieved in 14 of 15 patients. Twelve of 15 patients survived. There were few acute side effects. Long-term complications included newly diagnosed panhypopituitarism, a cerebrovascular accident from which the patient fully recovered, and an out-of-proton-field meningioma in the single patient who received previous radiotherapy. DISCUSSION: Fractionated proton radiotherapy is an effective treatment for children with craniopharyngioma. Longer follow-up is needed to evaluate late complications

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed 30 proton plans for 15 patients who underwent CT and MRI scans with an RB or water alone. Simulation was performed with a modified MRI endorectal coil and an RB with 100 mL of water or water alone. Doses of 78-82 gray equivalents were prescribed to the planning target volume. The two groups were compared for three structures: rectum, rectal wall (RW), and rectal wall 7 cm (RW7) at the level of the planning target volume. RESULTS: Rectum and RW volumes radiated to low, intermediate, and high doses were small: rectum V10, 33.7%; V50, 17.3%; and V70, 10.2%; RW V10, 32.4%; V50, 20.4%; and V70, 14.6%. The RB effectively increased the rectal volume for all cases (139.8 +/- 44.9 mL vs. 217.7 +/- 32.2 mL (p < 0.001). The RB also decreased the volume of the rectum radiated to doses V10-V65 (p < or = 0.05); RW for V10-V50; and RW7 for V10-V35. An absolute rectum V50 improvement >5% was seen for the RB in 5 of 15 cases, for a benefit of 9.2% +/- 2.3% compared with 2.4% +/- 1.3% for the remaining 10 cases (p < 0.001). Similar benefit was seen for the rectal wall. No benefit was seen for doses > or =70 gray equivalents for the rectum, RW, or RW7. No benefit of < or =1% was seen with an RB in 46% for the rectum V70 and in 40% for the rectal wall V70. CONCLUSIONS: Rectum and rectal wall doses with proton radiation were low whether using water or an RB. Selected patients will have a small but significant advantage with an RB; however, water alone was well tolerated and will be an alternative for most patients

0	410	The effect of beam energy on the quality of IMRT plans for prostate conformal radiotherapy.[see comment]	Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Humans, Male, Neutrons, Photons, Prostatic Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Prostatic Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Protons, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Risk, Tomography Scanners,X-Ray Computed	Three dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT) for prostate cancer is most commonly delivered with high-energy photons, typically in the range of 10-21 MV. With the advent of Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT), an increase in the number of monitor units (MU) relative to 3DCRT has lead to a concern about secondary malignancies. This risk becomes more relevant at higher photon energies where there is a greater neutron contribution. Subsequently, the majority of IMRT prostate treatments being delivered today are with 6-10 MV photons where neutron production is negligible. However, the absolute risk is small [Hall, E. J. Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy, Protons, and the Risk of Second Cancers. Int J Radiat Oncol Bio Phys 65, 1-7 (2006); Kry, F. S., Salehpour, M., Followill, D. S., Stovall, M., Kuban, D. A., White, R. A., and Rosen, I. I. The Calculated Risk of Fatal Secondary Malignancies From Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy. Int J Radiat Oncol Bio Phys 62, 1195-1203 (2005).] and therefore it has been suggested that the use of an 18MV IMRT may achieve better target coverage and normal tissue sparing such that this benefit outweighs the risks. This paper investigates whether 18MV IMRT offer better target coverage and normal tissue sparing. Computed Tomography (CT) image sets of ten prostate cancer patients were acquired and two separate IMRT plans were created for each patient. One plan used 6 MV beams, and the other used 18 MV, both in a coplanar, non-opposed beam geometry. Beam arrangements and optimization constraints were the same for all plans. This work includes a comparison and discussion of the total integral dose, neutron dose conformity index, and total number of MU for plans generated with both energies

METHODS: The authors prospectively studied helium-ion irradiation and iodine 125 (125I) brachytherapy in a randomized, dynamically balanced trial. Of the 184 patients who met the eligibility criteria, 86 were treated with helium ions and 98 with 125I brachytherapy. RESULTS: No patients with uveal melanoma had a history of systemic malignancy. Tumors were less than 15 mm in maximum diameter and less than 10 mm in thickness. A minimum tumor dose of 70 GyE was delivered to the tumor apex. There was a significantly higher local recurrence rate after 125I brachytherapy than after helium-ion irradiation. Enucleations occurred more frequently after brachytherapy (relative risk = 1.99; 95% confidence interval, 0.78-5.78). More anterior segment complications occurred after helium-ion irradiation. To date, there has been no measurable impact on survival. CONCLUSIONS: Most uveal melanomas can be managed with radiation with retention of the eye. There was better tumor control with helium-ion irradiation; however, there were more anterior segment complications

In extended tumours, ocular surface problems can result after therapy. In this study we examined ocular surface integrity of ten patients who underwent proton beam radiation between 1996 and 2002. METHODS: The patients were examined during their follow-up. Eight of the ten cases who underwent proton radiotherapy were recurrent tumours, which were previously treated with other adjuvant therapies. We performed a standard ophthalmological examination and detailed tear film diagnostics. RESULTS: The follow-up was 17-87 months (mean: 40.9+/-20.1). In six cases more than 50% of the upper and lower eyelids were included in the radiation field. All of these cases showed moderate to severe sicca symptoms. The impression cytology revealed squamous metaplasia of conjunctival cells in nine of ten cases. CONCLUSIONS: Squamous metaplasia of conjunctival epithelia indicates a radiogenic, persisting disturbance of differentiation of the conjunctival epithelial cells. The tear film instability correlates with the loss of mucin-secreting goblet cells and meibomian gland dysfunction

0	1900	Proton radiation therapy (PRT) for pediatric optic pathway gliomas: comparison with 3D planned conventional photons and a standard photon technique	Child, Child,Preschool, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Glioma/pa [Pathology], Glioma/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Male, Optic Chiasm, Optic Nerve, Optic Nerve Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Optic Nerve Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Injuries/pc [Prevention & Control], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Risk, Software, Survival, Survival Rate, Temporal Lobe, Universities	PURPOSE: Following adequate therapy, excellent long-term survival rates can be achieved for patients with optic pathway gliomas. Therefore, avoidance of treatment-related functional long-term sequelae is of utmost importance. Optimized sparing of normal tissue is of primary concern in the development of new treatment modalities. The present study compares proton radiation therapy (PRT) with a three-dimensional (3D)-planned multiport photon and a lateral beam photon technique for localized and extensive optic pathway tumors. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between February 1992 and November 1997, seven children with optic pathway gliomas underwent PRT. For this study, we computed proton, 3D photon, and lateral photon plans based on the same CT data sets, and using the same treatment planning software for all plans. Radiation exposure for normal tissue and discrete organs at risk was quantified based on dose-volume histograms. RESULTS: Gross tumor volume (GTV) ranged from 3.9 cm3 to 127.2 cm3. Conformity index (relation of encompassing isodose to GTV volume) was 2.3 for protons, 2.9 for 3D photons, and 7.3 for lateral photons. The relative increase of normal tissue (NT) encompassed at several isodose levels in relation to NT encompassed by the 95% proton isodose volume was computed. Relative NT volume of proton plan isodoses at the 95%, 90%, 80%, 50%, and 25% isodose level increased from 1 to 1.6, 2.8, 6.4, to a maximum of 13.3. Relative volumes for 3D photons were 1.6, 2.4, 3.8, 11.5, and 34.8. Lateral plan relative values were 6, 8.3, 11.5, 19.2, and 26.8. Analysis for small (<20 cm3) and larger (> 80 cm3) tumors showed that protons encompassed the smallest volumes of NT at all isodose levels. Comparable conformity and high-dose gradient were achieved for proton and 3D photon plans in small tumors. However, with increasing tumor volume and complexity, differences became larger. At the 50% isodose level, 3D photons were superior to lateral photons for small tumors; this advantage was equalized for larger tumors. At the lowest isodose level, 3D photons encompassed the highest amount of NT. Analysis of organs at risk showed that PRT reduced doses to the contralateral optic nerve by 47% and 77% compared to 3D photons and lateral photons, respectively. Reductions were also seen for the chiasm (11% and 16%) and pituitary gland (13% and 16%), with differences at clinically relevant tolerance levels. Furthermore, reduced dose exposure of both temporal lobes (sparing 39% and 54%) and frontal lobes was achieved with PRT. CONCLUSION: PRT offered a high degree of conformity to target volumes and steep dose gradients, thus leading to substantial normal tissue sparing in high- and low-dose areas. It is expected that this will result in decreased long-term toxicity in the maturing child. Advantages of proton versus 3D photon plans became increasingly apparent with increasing target size and tumor complexity. Even in small tumors, conformity of 3D photon irradiation came at the expense of a larger amount of NT receiving moderate to low radiation doses. Lateral photons resulted in inferior dose distribution with high radiation exposure of clinically relevant normal tissues

In the case of proton therapy, secondary neutrons generated in the accelerator head and inside the patient reach many areas in the patient body. Due to the improved efficacy of management of cancer patients, the number of long term survivors post-radiation treatment is increasing substantially. This results in concern about the risk of radiation-induced cancer appearing at late post-treatment times. This paper presents a case study to determine the effective dose from secondary neutrons in patients undergoing proton treatment. A whole-body patient model, VIP-Man, was employed as the patient model. The geometry dataset generated from studies made on VIP-Man was implemented into the GEANT4 Monte Carlo code. Two proton treatment plans for tumours in the lung and paranasal sinus were simulated. The organ doses and ICRP-60 radiation and tissue weighting factors were used to calculate the effective dose. Results show whole body effective doses for the two proton plans of 0.162 Sv and 0.0266 Sv, respectively, to which the major contributor is due to neutrons from the proton treatment nozzle. There is a substantial difference among organs depending on the treatment site

OBJECTIVE: To present the surgical technique of total spondylectomy for a chordoma of the C5 vertebral body. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Malignant bone tumors require wide resection. Wide resection by total en bloc spondylectomy is difficult or not feasible for malignant vertebral tumors of the cervical spine due to the peculiar anatomic complexity of this region, including the vertebral arteries and the neural structures. There are no previous reports of en bloc resection of cervical spine tumors with wide surgical margins. METHODS: Using staged posterior and anterior approaches, a total en bloc spondylectomy and spine arthrodesis was performed. En bloc excision of a C5 chordoma was achieved using a threadwire T-saw (Tomita and Kawahara, Kanazawa, Japan) with surgical margins free of tumor. The patient received postoperative adjuvant proton beam radiation therapy. RESULTS: The patient remains disease-free 9 years after the operation. CONCLUSION: Total en bloc spondylectomy with wide surgical margins is feasible for malignant bone tumors of the cervical spine

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixteen patients with intracranial meningioma (histopathologically proven in 13/16 cases) were treated with PRT between July 1997 and July 2002. Eight patients had skull base lesions. Thirteen patients received PRT after surgery either as adjuvant therapy for incomplete resection (eight patients) or for recurrence (five patients). Three patients received radical PRT after presumptive diagnosis based on imaging. The median prescribed dose was 56 CGE (range, 52.2-64, CGE=proton Gy X 1.1) at 1.8-2.0 CGE (median, 2.0) per fraction. Gross tumor volume and planning target volume ranged from 0.8 to 87.6 cc (median, 17.5) and 4.6-208.1 cc (median 107.7), respectively. Late ophthalmologic and non-ophthalmologic toxicity was assessed using the Subjective, Objective, Management and Analytic scale (SOMA) of the Late Effects of Normal Tissue scoring system and National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, v3.0) grading system, respectively. The median follow-up time was 34.1 months (range, 6.5-67.8). RESULTS: Cumulative 3-year local control, progression-free survival and overall survival were 91.7, 91.7 and 92.7%, respectively. No patient died from recurrent meningioma. One patient progressed locally after PRT. Radiographic follow-up (median, 34 months) revealed an objective response in three patients and stable disease in 12 patients. Cumulative 3-year toxicity free survival was 76.2%. One patient presented with radiation induced optic neuropathy (SOMA Grade 3) and retinopathy (SOMA Grade 2) 8.8 and 30.4 months after treatment, respectively. These patients with ophthalmologic toxicity received doses higher than those allowed for the optic/ocular structures. Another patient developed a symptomatic brain necrosis (CTCAE Grade 4) 7.2 months after treatment. No radiation-induced hypothalamic/pituitary dysfunction was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Spot-scanning PRT is an effective treatment for patient with untreated, recurrent or incompletely resected intracranial meningiomas. It offers highly conformal irradiation for complex-shaped intracranial meningiomas, while delivering minimal non-target dose. Observed ophthalmologic toxicity is dose-related

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The charts of 6 patients (7 eyes) with Sturge-Weber syndrome and choroidal hemangiomas were reviewed. An exudative retinal detachment was the indication for treatment in all cases. The mean age of the 6 patients was 13 years (range, 4 to 20 years). The minimum follow-up time was 1 year. Patients were checked for initial and final best-corrected visual acuity, fundus examination, fluorescein angiography, and tumor thickness on B-scan ultrasonography. The patients were treated with radiotherapy. A total dose of 20 Grays was applied to 7 eyes: 2 with a circumscribed choroidal hemangioma underwent proton therapy and 5 with diffuse hemangioma were treated by external beam irradiation. RESULTS: Complete resolution of the subretinal fluid was achieved in all cases with the tumor height decreased. Visual acuity improved to 1 line or more in 5 eyes and remained stable in 2 eyes. Two cases that underwent proton therapy developed radiation retinopathy. CONCLUSION: External beam radiation is an effective and safe option in the management of choroidal hemangiomas complicated by retinal detachment. Based on our experience, proton therapy should be reserved for sporadic circumscribed choroidal hemangioma

Autopsy findings in 15 of these patients are reported. Ten patients received pituitary radiation (average dose, 116 Gy in six fractions) for progressive neovascularization retinopathy due to diabetes mellitus. Evidence of a time-dependent course of progressive fibrosis in their pituitary glands was found. Five patients were treated for eosinophilic adenomas. Although they had lower average doses of radiation (56 Gy in six fractions), their pituitary glands showed cystic cavitation of the adenomas. The adenomas thus appeared more radiosensitive than the normal pars anterior, which, in turn, was more radiosensitive than the adjacent neurohypophysis. No significant radiation changes were found in the surrounding brain or cranial nerves. The endocrine organs under pituitary control showed varying degrees of atrophy, and clinical tests revealed progressive hypofunction. It was concluded that charged-particle therapy produced a sharply delineated focal radiation lesion confined to the pituitary gland but did not cause injury to the critical structures of the surrounding central nervous system

METHODS AND MATERIALS: One normal human and four human-tumor cell lines were used. Cells were irradiated with carbon ions accelerated by the Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba (HIMAC) at National Institute of Radiological Sciences in Japan. The LET values were estimated to be 13.18 keV/microm for low-LET beams and 76.92 +/- 0.20 keV/microm for high-LET beams. Fractionated-dose irradiations were carried out with 5 fractions within a 24-h interval. RESULTS: The surviving fractions for the fractionated-dose irradiation with X-rays and carbon ions decreased exponentially with increasing the number of fractions in the tumor cell lines. In contrast, the surviving fractions for the carbon ions in normal human cells decreased exponentially as well as the tumor cell lines, while it tended to level off from the 3rd to the 5th fraction in the case of using X-rays. CONCLUSION: The change in both the recovery ratio of the PLDR and radiosensitivity by every fractionated-dose irradiation depends on individual cell lines and the quality of radiations

DESIGN: Randomized, double-masked clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 188 patients with small or medium-sized choroidal melanomas (<15 mm in diameter and <5 mm in height) near the optic disc or macula (within 4 disc diameters of either structure). METHODS: Patients were treated with proton beam therapy at doses of either 50 CGE or 70 CGE between October 1989 and July 1994, and followed up biannually through April 1998. Outcomes included visual acuity, radiation complications, melanoma recurrence, and metastasis. RESULTS: Proportions of patients retaining visual acuity of at least 20/200 were similar in the 2 dose groups at 5 years after radiation (approximately 55%). Similar numbers of patients in each group experienced tumor regrowth (2 patients at 50 CGE vs 3 patients at 70 CGE; P>.99) and metastasis (7 patients at 50 CGE vs 8 patients at 70 CGE;P=.79). Five-year rates of radiation maculopathy also were similar (for both groups, approximately 75% for tumors within 1 disc diameter and 40% for tumors >1 disc diameter from the macula). Rates of radiation papillopathy were nonsignificantly decreased in the 50-CGE treatment group when tumors were located 1 disc diameter or less from the optic disc (P=.20). Patients treated with the lower dose also experienced significantly less visual field loss. CONCLUSIONS: This level of dose reduction did not result in a lesser degree of visual acuity loss. The lower-dose group did experience significantly less visual field loss. Local tumor recurrence and metastatic death rates were similar in both dose groups. Arch Ophthalmol. 2000;118:773-778

The proposed fractionation strategy consisted of a SIB treatment following a first phase of conventional fractionation to the elective volume (named SEQ/SIB). The novel method was compared to a conventional sequential fractionation and to a full SIB approach. Treatment plans were designed for five patients on the proton planning system developed for spot scanning at the Paul Scherrer Institute of Villigen (CH). Three to five beams were applied for all plans and fractionations. All effective dose distributions were corrected using biological models to take into account repopulation and time at repopulation onset. Corrected and uncorrected plans were compared on the basis of dosimetry criteria and dose-volume histograms. The results showed a dosimetric advantage for the SEQ/SIB approach in terms of target coverage, without significant disadvantages for risk structures and healthy tissue. Considering the high logistic impact and the limited availability of radiation facilities, the clinical exploitation of accelerated SIB treatment with protons appears promising

0	4720	Primary transpupillary thermotherapy for 18 small posterior pole uveal melanomas	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Angiography, Disease-Free Survival, Eye, Female, Fluorescein Angiography, France, Humans, Hyperthermia,Induced/mt [Methods], Lasers, Male, Melanoma, Melanoma/di [Diagnosis], Melanoma/pp [Physiopathology], Melanoma/th [Therapy], Methods, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/di [Diagnosis], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/pp [Physiopathology], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/th [Therapy], Patients, Prospective Studies, Pupil, Recurrence, Survival, Survival Rate, Treatment Outcome, Uveal Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Uveal Neoplasms/pp [Physiopathology], Uveal Neoplasms/th [Therapy], Visual Acuity, Visual Acuity/ph [Physiology]	PURPOSE: To evaluate transpupillary thermotherapy (TTT) for the treatment of small uveal melanomas of the posterior pole. DESIGN: Prospective, nonrandomized interventional case series. METHODS: Eighteen patients underwent TTT for small uveal melanomas located in the posterior pole of the eyes. Tumors were between 2.5 and 4 mm in thickness. TTT was performed with a diode laser at 810 nm. Patients had between one and three TTT sessions, with an intensity adapted to the coloration of the fundus impact. Biomicroscopic examination, ultrasonographic measurements, and angiography were performed before and two months, four months, and six months after treatment, then regularly during follow-up. RESULTS: Eight of the 18 tumors regressed and 10 recurred. The one- and two-year metastasis-free survival rates calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method were, respectively, 61.11% to 44.44% (95% confidence interval). Recurrences were managed with enucleation (three patients), proton beam therapy (six), or additional thermotherapy (one). After treatment, visual acuity was maintained or improved for the eight patients with nonrecurrent tumors. Pathologic analysis of the three enucleated eyes revealed scleral invasion. CONCLUSIONS: Despite encouraging initial short-term results obtained with TTT for the management of small choroidal melanomas, the occurrence of severe complications, especially recurrences and insufficient local tumor control, should raise concern about indications for primary TTT given as isolated treatment for small melanomas of the posterior pole	
0	2108	Comparative risk assessment of secondary cancer incidence after treatment of Hodgkin's disease with photon and proton radiation	Adult, Dose Fractionation, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Female, Hodgkin Disease/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Incidence, Neoplasms,Radiation-Induced/ep [Epidemiology], Neoplasms,Radiation-Induced/et [Etiology], Neoplasms,Second Primary/ep [Epidemiology], Neoplasms,Second Primary/et [Etiology], Nuclear Medicine, Organ Specificity, Photons, Photons/ae [Adverse Effects], Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Probability, Protons, Protons/ae [Adverse Effects], Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/ae [Adverse Effects], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Research, Risk, Risk Assessment, Switzerland	Probabilities for secondary cancer incidence have been estimated for a patient with Hodgkin's disease for whom treatment has been planned with different radiation modalities using photons and protons. The ICRP calculation scheme has been used to calculate cancer incidence from dose distributions. For this purpose, target volumes as well as critical structures have been outlined in the CT set of a patient with Hodgkin's disease. Dose distributions have been calculated using conventional as well as intensity-modulated treatment techniques using photon and proton radiation. The cancer incidence has been derived from the mean doses for each organ. The results of this work are: (a) Intensity-modulated treatment of Hodgkin's disease using nine photon fields (15 MV) results in nearly the same cancer incidence as treating with two opposed photon fields (6 MV). (b) Intensity-modulated treatment using nine proton fields (maximum energy 177.25 MeV) results in nearly the same cancer incidence as treating with one proton field (160 MeV). (c) Irradiation with protons using the spot scanning technique decreases the avoidable cancer incidence compared to photon treatment by a factor of about two. This result is independent of the number of beams used. Our work suggests that there are radiotherapy indications in which intensity-modulated treatments will result in little or no reduction of cancer incidence compared to conventional treatments. However, proton treatment can result in a lower cancer incidence than photon treatment	
0	885	Reducing toxicity from craniospinal irradiation: using proton beams to treat medulloblastoma in young children	California, Cerebellar Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Child,Preschool, Cobalt, Cranial Irradiation/mt [Methods], Female, Humans, Lymphocyte Count, Medulloblastoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Pilot Projects, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Spinal Cord/re [Radiation Effects], Treatment Outcome, X-Rays	PURPOSE: We report on a radiation treatment technique that has reduced the dose to critical normal structures in children with medulloblastoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three children between the ages of 3 and 4 with stage M2 or M3 medulloblastoma were treated between 2001 and 2003 with craniospinal irradiation using protons. Patients received 36 cobalt gray equivalent to the craniospinal axis, then 18 cobalt gray equivalent to the posterior fossa. The cranium was treated with opposed lateral fields. The spine was treated with three matched posteroanterior fields, with the beam stopping just beyond the thecal sac. The posterior fossa was then treated with alternating posteroanterior, right posterior oblique, and left posterior oblique fields, with the beam stopping just proximal to the cochlea. The use of general anesthesia and pre-porting with diagnostic-quality x-rays allowed precise patient positioning. RESULTS: Craniospinal irradiation delivered via conformal proton irradiation substantially reduced the dose to the cochlea and vertebral bodies and virtually eliminated the exit dose through thorax, abdomen, and pelvis. Despite concurrent chemotherapy, a clinically significant lymphocyte count reduction was not seen. Patients tolerated treatment well; acute side effects (e.g., nausea, decreased appetite, and odynophagia) were mild. All patients completed therapy without interruption. CONCLUSION: Our proton-beam technique for craniospinal irradiation of pediatric medulloblastoma has successfully reduced normal-tissue doses and acute treatment-related sequelae. This technique may be especially advantageous in children with a history of myelosuppression, who might not other wise tolerate irradiation	
1	650	Chordomas of the base of the skull and upper cervical spine. One hundred patients irradiated by a 3D conformal technique combining photon and proton beams	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Child, Chordoma/pa [Pathology], Chordoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, France, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Multivariate Analysis, Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Prognosis, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Skull Base Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Skull Base Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Spinal Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Spinal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Survival Rate, Treatment Outcome	To define the prognostic factors for local control and overall survival among 100 consecutive patients with chordoma of the base of skull or upper cervical spine treated by fractionated irradiation combining proton and photon beams. Between December 1993 and August 2002, 100 patients (median age: 53 years [8 - 85], M/F sex ratio: 3/2) were treated by a combination of high-energy photons and protons. The proton component was delivered at the Centre de Protontherapie d'Orsay (CPO) by a 201 MeV beam. The median total dose delivered to the tumor volume was 67 GyECo. With a median follow-up of 31 months [range: 0 - 87], 25 tumours relapsed locally. The 2- and 4-year local control rates were 86.3% (+/-3.9%) and 53.8% (+/-7.5%), respectively. According to multivariate analysis, at least 95% of the tumor volume encompassed by the 95% isodose (p = 0.048; RR: 3.4 95%CI [1.01 - 11.8]) and a minimal dose delivered into the tumor volume <56 GyECo (p = 0.042; RR: 2.3 95%CI [1.03 - 5.2]) were independent prognostic factors of local control. Ten patients died. The 2- and 5-year overall survival rates were 94.3% (+/-2.5%) and 80.5% (+/-7.2%), respectively. According to multivariate analysis, local tumor control (p = 0.005; RR: 21 95%CI [2.2 - 200]) was a prognostic factor of overall survival. For chordomas of the base of the skull and upper cervical spine treated by surgery and irradiation combining photons and protons, the quality of irradiation, reflected by homogeneity of the dose into the tumor volume, is a major factor of local control. Close attention must be paid to minimize the underdosed areas close to critical organs. The role of surgical resection remains paramount, and a trial of dose escalation would have to consider an increase in the dose to critical organs, especially as current results indicate the low toxicity of this treatment	
1	2192	Astatine-211-labeled radiotherapeutics: an emerging approach to targeted alpha-particle radiotherapy. [Review] [104 refs]	Alpha Particles, Alpha Particles/tu [Therapeutic Use], Antibodies,Monoclonal/tu [Therapeutic Use], Astatine, Astatine/tu [Therapeutic Use], Brachytherapy, DNA, DNA/me [Metabolism], Humans, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiation, Radioimmunotherapy, Radiotherapy, Research, Silicon, Tissue Distribution, Universities	Targeted radiotherapy or endoradiotherapy is an appealing approach to cancer treatment because of the potential for delivering curative doses of radiation to tumor while sparing normal tissues. Radionuclides that decay by the emission of alpha-particles such as the heavy halogen astatine-211 (211At) offer the exciting prospect of combining cell-specific molecular targets with radiation having a range in tissue of only a few cell diameters. Herein, the radiobiological advantages of alpha-particle targeted radiotherapy will be reviewed, and the rationale for using 211At for this purpose will be described. The chemistry of astatine is similar to that of iodine; however, there are important differences which make the synthesis and evaluation of 211At-labeled compounds more challenging. Perhaps the most successful approach that has been developed involves the astatodemetallation of tin, silicon or mercury precursors. Astatine-211 labeled agents that have been investigated for targeted radiotherapy include [211At]astatide, 211At- labeled particulates, 211At-labeled naphthoquinone derivatives, 211At-labeled methylene blue, 211At-labeled DNA precursors, meta-[211At]astatobenzylguanidine, 211At-labeled biotin conjugates, 211At-labeled bisphosphonates, and 211At-labeled antibodies and antibody fragments. The status of these 211At-labeled compounds will be discussed in terms of their labeling chemistry, cytotoxicity in cell culture, as well as their tissue distribution and therapeutic efficacy in animal models of human cancers. Finally, an update on the status of the first clinical trial with an 211At-labeled targeted therapeutic, 211At-labeled chimeric anti-tenascin antibody 81C6, will be provided. [References: 104]

A 20-year-old patient with NF2 presenting deafness due to bilateral acoustic neurinomas and unilateral amaurosis due to a meningioma of the optic nerve developed a pigmented parapapillary choroidal tumor. Despite signs indicating the diagnosis of a melanoma, periodic observation was chosen in order to postpone functional amputation following optic nerve irradiation. The tumor growth was slow during the 5 years that followed, and once progression became rapid, the tumor was treated by accelerated proton beam radiotherapy. One year later, visual acuity diminished due to actinic optic neuropathy and was stabilized at 0.3 for the 2 following years. The tumor presented objective signs of regression, and no sign of metastatic disease was observed. The therapeutic approach in this case provided local control of the tumor while preserving useful visual function

METHODS: We retrospectively identified four patients who presented with uveal melanoma and rhegmatogenous retinal detachment simultaneously and six patients in whom a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment developed 11-100 months (mean, 44.8 months) after radiotherapy for a choroidal melanoma. RESULTS: All four patients with simultaneous presentation of uveal melanoma and retinal detachment underwent successful retinal detachment repair (cases 1 and 4, scleral buckle; case 2, pars plana vitrectomy, and case 3, pneumatic retinoplexy). Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment occurring after proton beam or plaque radiotherapy of uveal melanoma was repaired successfully in five of six patients with scleral buckling alone or in combination with pars plana vitrectomy. In the short follow-up period of this study, we did not observe tumor recurrence either before or after retinal detachment repair. CONCLUSION: Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment associated with uveal melanoma may be treated successfully using conventional retinal surgical techniques. The benefits of retinal detachment repair must be weighed against any theoretical increased risk of extra-scleral extension of the melanoma. Long-term follow-up evaluation will be required to determine the safety of various retinal detachment repair techniques in these eyes

In osteogenesis imperfecta hyperplastic heterotopic ossification can be induced by hyperplastic callus formation caused by trauma or operation. Heterotopic ossifications can be found in numerous benign diseases. The successful use of low dose radiotherapy in the treatment of heterotopic ossifications is well-known from the literature. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We treated two children (a 13-year-old girl and a ten-year-old boy) with heterotopic ossifications of the lower extremities in osteogenesis imperfecta type IV (Lobstein) with a low dose irradiation (10 x 1 Gy, respectively 6 x 1 Gy) under megavoltage conditions. RESULTS: After radiotherapy the children were painfree and the hyperplastic callus was considerably reduced. The previously immobilized patients could partly be mobilized. Thereby it could be contributed to the rehabilitation of the patients. New hyperplastic callus formation was not observed in the irradiated areas so far. CONCLUSION: Analogous to the successful radiation of heterotopic ossifications in other benign diseases radiation therapy seems to be a successful treatment of hyperplastic callus formation in osteogenesis imperfecta. Despite the late risks of radiotherapy radiation treatment of benign diseases in children might be indicated

Each patient received five proton beam treatments in eight to ten days, totalling 4,730 to 8,570 rads at the tumor. No complications occurred during the treatment or follow-up period, which, at the time of this writing, ranges from one to 24 months, with an average of 12 months. No further growth of the tumor has been observed in any patient. Different signs of tumor regression have been noted. Resolution of the serous retinal detachments that accompanied some tumors is the earliest finding. Pigment changes over the surface of the tumor and adjacent pigment epithelium is a usual initial tumor response. Fluorescein angiography initially showed decreased leakage of dye; later, destruction of the tumor's vasculature and elimination of fluorescein leakage became evident. Only large choroidal vessels remained patient. Ultrasonography revealed decreased height of the tumors postirradiation, and the radioactive phosphorus (32P) uptake test, repeated in one patient, turned negative on postirradiation measurements

After 21 months of follow-up no growth of the tumour has been observed, and shrinkage of the tumour was noted on the follow-up photographs and by ultrasonography. The 32P uptake test, which was positive before treatment, turned negative 14 months after irradiation. The described technique of proton beam irradiation might offer an alternative for the treatment of ciliary body melanomas when the present techniques of iridocyclectomy cannot be applied because of the size of the lesion

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We performed a retrospective analysis of 30 patients with unresectable sacral chordomas treated with carbon ion radiotherapy at the Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba, Japan. Twenty-three patients presented with no prior treatment, and the remaining 7 patients had locally recurrent disease following previous surgical resection. The median clinical target volume was 546 cm(3). The applied carbon ion dose ranged from 52.8 to 73.6 GyE (gray equivalent, median 70.4) in 16 fixed fractions over 4 weeks. RESULTS: At median follow-up of 30 months (range, 9 to 87 months), 26 patients were still alive and 24 patients remained continuously disease-free. Overall and cause-specific survival rates at 5 years were 52 and 94%, respectively. The overall local control rate at 5 years was 96%. Two patients experienced severe skin/soft tissue complications requiring skin grafts. No other treatment-related surgical interventions, including colostomy or urinary diversion, were carried out. All patients have remained ambulatory and able to stay at home after carbon ion radiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Carbon ion radiotherapy is effective and safe in the management of patients with unresectable sacral chordomas and offers a promising alternative to surgery

Overall survival, local control, complications, and predictive parameters are analyzed. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fourteen patients with sacral chordomas were treated with the charged particles helium and neon between 1977 and 1989. The median dose was 7565 cGyE and the median follow up is 5 years. All patients were treated post-operatively; ten had gross residual disease. RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier survival at 5 years is 85%. Overall 5-year local control is 55%. A trend to improved local control at 5 years was seen in patients treated with neon when compared to patients treated with helium (62% vs 34%), in patients following complete resection versus patients with gross residual tumor (75% vs 40%), and in patients who had treatment courses under 73 days (61% vs 21%). Distant metastases were seen in two patients (14%). No patient developed neurologic sequelae or pain syndromes. One previously irradiated patient required colostomy, one patient had delayed wound healing following a negative post-radiation biopsy, and one patient developed a second malignancy. There were no genitourinary complications. CONCLUSION: Our experience indicates that post-operative charged particle irradiation of sacral chordomas appears to result in reasonable local control and survival with acceptable risk, and that additional evaluation on the use of heavy charged particles is warranted

The potential of proton beam RT as an alternative to conventional brachytherapy was evaluated. Except for one local recurrence, 14 of 15 patients were locoregionally controlled for 15 to 57 months. Two-year local control rate and 2-year survival rate were 92.3% and 93.3%, respectively. Two cases of transient, radiation-induced proctitis (neither of which required surgical treatment) were the only complications despite a target dose that exceeded 8000 cGy in most cases. The results suggest that sharply localized, high-dose proton beam RT can produce an antitumor effect equivalent to that of conventional brachytherapy

METHODS AND MATERIALS: This study concerns 538 patients referred by French institutions between June 1991 and December 1996. The eye and tumor parameters were measured using ultrasonography and angiography. Since 1994, CT scans were performed in most patients to help determine the axial length and the shape of the ocular globe. Tantalum clips were inserted around the tumor by the referring ophthalmologist. There were 349 posterior pole tumors (64.9%), 130 equatorial tumors (24.1%), and 59 ciliary body tumors (11%). Two hundred four patients (37.9%) had T1 or T2 tumors, and 334 patients (62.1%) had T3 or T4 tumors. The median tumor diameter was 14.6 mm, and the median tumor height was 5.1 mm. All patients received 52 Gy (57.20 Gy Co-equivalent dose) on 4 consecutive days. The data were analyzed by December 1997. RESULTS: The CSS was 77.4% at 78 months, the overall survival was 73.8% and the local control was 89.0%. The CSS was not influenced by the patient age or the site of the tumor. It was 81.5% for T1 and T2 tumors, versus 75% for T3 and T4 tumors (P = 0.035). It was found that the tumor diameter, rather than the height, was the most important parameter affecting outcome. The metastatic rate was 8%. It depended on the T stage, tumor diameter and thickness, but not the tumor site. Thirty-eight enucleations were performed, most of them due to tumor progression and/or glaucoma. One-third of the patients in whom visual acuity was adequately scored before and after treatment had a stable, if not improved vision, and half the patients retained useful vision after treatment. CONCLUSION: The outcome of patients suffering from uveal melanoma and treated with high-energy protons compares favorably with other techniques of treatment. The tumor dimensions affected CSS and metastatic rate. Even though two-thirds of patients had posterior pole tumors, half of them retained useful vision

The choice of therapy depends on many factors, and plaque radiotherapy is often used. OBJECTIVES: To determine the outcome of plaque radiotherapy in the management of ciliary body melanoma and to identify the risk factors associated with the development of radiation complications, tumor recurrence, metastasis, and melanoma-related death after plaque radiotherapy of ciliary body melanoma. METHODS: We analyzed the clinical records of 136 patients with ciliary body melanoma who were treated with plaque radiotherapy between July 1976 and June 1992. RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 70 months. Using Kaplan-Meier survival estimates, the most frequent radiation complication at 5 years' follow-up was cataract, developing in 48% of the patients, followed by neovascular glaucoma (21%), retinopathy (20%), scleral necrosis (12%), and vitreous hemorrhage (11%). Visual acuity decrease (by > or =3 Snellen lines) was noted in 40% of the patients at 5 years. Kaplan-Meier estimates showed that 8% of the patients developed recurrence, 28% had metastasis, and 22% died of melanoma-related causes by 5 years. Univariate analysis demonstrated that the factors predictive of radiation cataract were superonasal (P = .003) and inferior tumor meridian (P = .02) compared with inferonasal meridian and apex dose rate greater than 57 cGy/h (P = .05). The development of neovascular glaucoma was significantly related to iris involvement with the ciliary body tumor (P<.001). The factors predictive of development of radiation retinopathy were base dose rate greater than 230 cGy/h (P = .03) and the presence of diabetes mellitus (P = .05). The only predictor of metastasis was tumor thickness greater than 7 mm (P = .02). The risk factors for melanoma-related death were the presence of metastasis (P<.001), tumor thickness greater than 7 mm (P = .02), and recurrence (P = .02). Multivariate analyses showed that the most significant variables predictive of the development of scleral necrosis were intraocular pressure greater than 15 mm Hg (P<.001) and tumor thickness greater than 7 mm (P = .007). The most significant predictive factors for vitreous hemorrhage were visual acuity of 20/40 to 20/200 (P = .02) and intraocular pressure greater than 15 mm Hg (P = .02). The best subset of independent predictors of vision decrease were mushroom tumor shape (P = .002), age older than 61 years (P = .006), and superonasal meridian (P = .04). The risks for melanoma-related death were presence of metastasis (P<.001) and tumor thickness greater than 7 mm (P = .01). There was no group of significant variables predictive for radiation cataract, neovascular glaucoma, retinopathy, tumor recurrence, and metastasis in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Plaque radiotherapy offers 92% 5-year local control rate for ciliary body melanoma. Metastasis occurs in 28% of the patients treated with this method by 5 years. Patients with tumors greater than 7 mm in thickness are at greater risk than patients with thinner tumors for metastatic disease and melanoma-related death. Major radiation complications include radiation cataract, neovascular glaucoma, retinopathy, and scleral necrosis

The indications for double-dose irradiation with the same radio-element corresponded to "macroscopically abnormal" situations: immediate and prolonged radioresistance, recurrence or secondary radioresistance. Thirteen cases are called series 1 (Ruthenium) and 6 cases are called series 2 (protons). The series 1 allows a more reliable study as far as follow-up is higher (5.8 to 7.5 years) than in series 2 where the follow-up is shorter (13.6 to 29 months). Although double-dose irradiation was macroscopically efficient in 11 out of 13 cases in series 1, and in 3 out of 6 cases in series 2 (stabilization or decrease of tumour height measured before the second therapeutic session), 2 patients are deceased and 1 has a metastatic disease in the group "recurrence" of Ruthenium serie. Another one has also a metastatic disease in the group "recurrence" of protons series. Nevertheless double-dose radiotherapy allows a complementary decrease or stabilization of tumour height after a first session. It also decreases the indications for enucleation if there is no severe anatomic complications, when a tumour does not regress or recurs after a first session of radiations

The fourteen patients had chordomas or low grade chondrosarcomas and were all treated by the same techniques. The median tumor dose was 69.7 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE) with a range from 66.6 to 74.4 CGE. (CGE is used because modulated protons have an RBE of 1.1 compared to 60Co). The daily fraction size was 1.8-2.1 CGE. The median follow-up time is 48 months, ranging from 30 to 68 months. All treatments were planned using a computerized multi-dimensional system with the position of the pituitary outlined on the planning CT scan. Review of the dose distribution indicated that the dose to the pituitary ranged from 60.5 to 72.3 CGE, with a median of 67.6 CGE. One female patient had decreased thyroid and gonadotropin function at the time of diagnosis and has been on hormone replacement since that time. The other three females were all pre-menopausal at the time of radiotherapy. At this time four patients (3 males and 1 female) have developed endocrine abnormalities 14 to 45 months after irradiation. All four had evidence of hypothyroidism and two have also developed corticotropin deficiency. The three males had decreased testosterone levels; the female patient developed amenorrhea and hyperprolactinemia. All four are asymptomatic with ongoing hormone replacement

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-one patients with Stage I NSCLC (11 with Stage IA and 10 with Stage IB) underwent hypofractionated high-dose proton beam therapy. At the time of irradiation, patient age ranged from 51 to 85 years (median, 74 years). Nine patients were medically inoperable because of comorbidities, and 12 patients refused surgical resection. Histology was squamous cell carcinoma in 6 patients, adenocarcinoma in 14, and large cell carcinoma in 1. Tumor size ranged from 10 to 42 mm (median, 25 mm) in maximum diameter. Three and 18 patients received proton beam irradiation with total doses of 50 Gy and 60 Gy in 10 fractions, respectively, to primary tumor sites. RESULTS: Of 21 patients, 2 died of cancer and 2 died of pneumonia at a median follow-up period of 25 months. The 2-year overall and cause-specific survival rates were 74% and 86%, respectively. All but one of the irradiated tumors were controlled during the follow-up period. Five patients showed recurrences 6-29 months after treatment, including local progression and new lung lesions outside of the irradiated volume in 1 and 4 patients, respectively. The local progression-free and disease-free rates were 95% and 79% at 2 years, respectively. No therapy-related toxicity of Grade > or =3 was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Hypofractionated high-dose proton beam therapy seems feasible and effective for Stage I NSCLC. Proton beams may contribute to enhanced efficacy and lower toxicity in the treatment of patients with Stage I NSCLC

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified 13 STS patients treated with PT between July 1998 and May 2005 in our institutional database. Tumor histology varied with the most common histologic subtypes including liposarcoma and peripheral nerve sheet tumor. All tumors were located in vicinity of critical structures, such as the spinal cord, optic apparatus, bowel, kidney, or bowel. Of the patients, 6 and 5 patients received PT either as adjuvant therapy for non-R0 resection or for recurrence, respectively. Two patients received radical PT for unresectable disease. The median prescribed dose was 69.4 CGE (CGE = proton Gy x 1.1)-Gy (range, 50.4-76.0) at 1.8 to 2 CGE-Gy (median, 1.9) per fraction. Pre-PT anthracycline-based chemotherapy was delivered to 3 patients only. No patient has been lost to follow-up (median 48.1 months, range, 19.1-100.7 months). RESULTS: Of the 13 patients, all but 2 patients were alive. Local recurrence developed in 3 (23%) patients. The administered dose to these patients was < or =60 Gy-CGE. Distant control was achieved in all but 2 patients (lung metastasis), 1 of whom presented with a concomitant local recurrence. The 4-year local control and metastasis-free survival rates were 74.1% and 84.6%, respectively. Late grade > or =2 toxicity was observed in only 2 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Spot scanning PT is an effective and safe treatment for patient with STS in critical locations. The observed toxicity rate was acceptable

Olfactory neuroblastoma is a rare disease, and a standard treatment strategy has not been established. Radiation therapy for ONB is challenging because of the proximity of ONBs to critical organs. Proton-beam therapy can provide better dose distribution compared with X-ray irradiation because of its physical characteristics, and is deemed to be a feasible treatment modality. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A retrospective review was performed on 14 patients who underwent PBT for ONB as definitive treatment at the National Cancer Center Hospital East (Kashiwa, Chiba, Japan) from November 1999 to February 2005. A total dose of PBT was 65 cobalt Gray equivalents (Gy(E)), with 2.5-Gy(E) once-daily fractionations. RESULTS: The median follow-up period for surviving patients was 40 months. One patient died from disseminated disease. There were two persistent diseases, one of which was successfully salvaged with surgery. The 5-year overall survival rate was 93%, the 5-year local progression-free survival rate was 84%, and the 5-year relapse-free survival rate was 71%. Liquorrhea was observed in one patient with Kadish's stage C disease (widely destroying the skull base). Most patients experienced Grade 1 to 2 dermatitis in the acute phase. No other adverse events of Grade 3 or greater were observed according to the RTOG/EORTC acute and late morbidity scoring system. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results of PBT for ONB achieved excellent local control and survival outcomes without serious adverse effects. Proton-beam therapy is considered a safe and effective modality that warrants further study	
1	3649	Conservative treatment of uveal melanoma: probability of eye retention after proton treatment	Actuarial Analysis, Boston, Ciliary Body, Eye, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Immunotherapy, Male, Massachusetts, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Melanoma/su [Surgery], Ophthalmologic Surgical Procedures, Probability, Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research, Risk, Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Uveal Neoplasms/su [Surgery]	Enucleation was performed after proton treatment in 57 of 1006 (5.7%) uveal melanoma patients treated with proton beam therapy at the Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory between July 1975 and December 31, 1986. Only 2% of 99 patients with small tumors and 4% of 566 patients with intermediate size tumors underwent enucleation after treatment; 10% of 341 patients with large tumors lost the treated eye. No eyes were removed after 52 months, with 89% of enucleations performed during the first 36 months after treatment. Eye retention rates at 60 months were 89.1 +/- 3.0% for the entire group, and 97 +/- 3.7%, 92.7 +/- 3.1%, and 78.3 +/- 7.0% in patients with small, intermediate, and large tumors, respectively. Significantly greater enucleation rates were observed in patients with large tumors than in those with intermediate tumors (p = less than .0001), in patients with tumor height greater than 8 mm relative to those with tumors less than or equal to 8 mm, p = (less than .0001), with tumor diameter greater than 16 mm compared to less than or equal to 16 mm, (p = less than .0001), and with tumor involvement of the ciliary body compared to involvement of the choroid only (p = less than .0001). Possible strategies to decrease the likelihood of enucleation in patients at apparently increased risk of losing the eye after conservative therapy, that is, those with large tumors involving the ciliary body, might include a lower total dose, a more protracted treatment course, or a lower radiation dose and adjuvant treatment with chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy, with hyperthermia, or with other radiation sensitizers

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Three dose plans were made for each of the six patients: one proton plan, including three beams covering the primary tumour and adjacent lymph nodes and three boost beams covering the primary tumour: one X-ray plan, eight beams including a boost with four beams and one mixed plan with four X-ray beams and a boost with three proton beams. A three dimensional treatment-planning systems, TMS, was used. The evaluation of the different plans was made by applying the biological models TCP and NTCP on the dose distributions in terms of dose-volume histograms. RESULTS: The comparison shows advantages of using protons instead of X-rays for all six patients, but in three of them, the advantage is only marginal. The dose-limiting organ at risk is the small bowel, but the proton plan and the mixed plan also spare the bladder and the femoral heads better. At 5% NTCP in any risk organ, the calculated mean TCP value for the six patients is increased by 14%-units with the proton plan and 8%-units with the mixed plan compared to X-rays only. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy has potential advantages when treating medically inoperable patients with a large rectal cancer over conventional X-ray therapy. Since the benefits are comparatively small, although clinically worthwhile, large randomised studies are needed

The localisation and locally-destructive growth require a multidisciplinary diagnostic and therapeutic concept early on. The goal of the present study was to present a reproducible strategy for quality assurance. PATIENTS AND METHOD: We retrospectively analysed the hospital records of 10 consecutive patients (4 women and 6 men) whom we had treated during a period of 7 years. RESULTS: The first step in therapy was tumour resection in 9 cases. One patient initially underwent stereotactic radiation. Postoperative radiation was not included a priori, but discussed individually depending on the degree of resection, the patient's age and physical condition. After an average 5 years follow up, 100 % of patients are alive. In all patients, tumour control was achieved. CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis for patients with chordomas of the skull base has improved considerably in recent years. New technologies like intraoperative navigation and improved radiation procedures have contributed to this improvement. The basis for treatment remains, however, the greatest possible surgical exstirpation with minimal surgical morbidity. Special attention should be paid in this connection to the stability of the cervical spine and the craniocervical transition border. In advanced tumour growth, complete resection is often not possible. Proton and heavy-ion radiation are promising new forms of therapy, which can also be applied after conventional radiation has been performed. A directed multidisciplinary procedure guarantees years of survival with good quality of life in many cases

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-eight adult patients with chordoma of the sacrum (23), base of skull (20) or mobile spine (5), were seen between 1958-1992. Forty-four were referred post operatively with overt disease and 31 of these were irradiated with conventionally fractionated radiation to a median dose of 50 Gy/25 fractions/5 weeks (range 25-60 Gy). Eight received a hyperfractionation protocol of 1 Gy, 4 hourly, 4 times a day (median 40 Gy/44 fractions/14 days), two sacral patients were treated with a hypofractionation protocol and three cases with skull base tumours were referred elsewhere for proton therapy. Endpoints measured were survival from diagnosis, objective response rate, symptomatic response rate and clinical or radiological progression-free survival from radiotherapy. RESULTS: Median survival was 62 months (range 4-240 month) from diagnosis with no difference between clival and non-clival presentations. One complete and no partial responses were identified in 23 assessable patients. A subjective response was recorded for 12/14 (85%) with pain and 10/23 (45%) with neurological signs or symptoms, and the median time to progression for those with overt disease was 35 months (range 5-220 months). There was no survival advantage to patients receiving radiation doses > 50 Gy (median 60 Gy) compared to doses < 50 Gy (median 40 Gy). There was no difference between the conventional or hyperfractionation regimens with respect to the degree or duration of symptomatic response, or in progression-free survival. Fourteen patients who progressed after irradiation were retreated with surgery (6), irradiation (7) or both modalities (1). Median survival after retreatment was 18 months, and the only two symptomatic responses seen were with reirradiation, and after failure of relatively low dose initial therapy. At last follow-up, 35 were dead of or with disease, seven are alive with disease, and two are disease-free. Thirty-eight had local disease persistence as the sole site of failure, and four developed distant metastases initially or subsequently. DISCUSSION: Overt residual chordoma is rarely cured with conventional external beam irradiation, but treatment does provide useful and prolonged palliation of pain for most patients. Chordoma is a disease with low metastatic potential, and better local control may improve survival. Complete resection rates may be improved for patients with sacral disease by using planned excisions in centres experienced in treating this rare disease. Because radiation therapy may prove to be more successful in controlling microscopic disease, it should be considered as a pre- or postoperative adjuvant to a macroscopically complete resection. Patients with skull base disease should also be resected in centres specializing in this surgery, but complete excision is unlikely. These patients will not obtain local control with conventional photon irradiation, and suitable patients should be considered for irradiation with stereotactic photon or particle beam therapy. For patients who progress after irradiation, there is limited symptomatic benefit to retreatment with surgery or reirradiation, and this should be limited to treating life-threatening complications

OBJECTIVE: To examine a large clinical series of patients with intraocular melanoma to determine if light irises are associated with increased risk of death from these tumors. METHODS: A total of 1162 patients treated with proton irradiation between 1984 and 1996 were observed through 1997. RESULTS: Iris color in the patients was blue or gray in 48%, green or hazel in 30%, and brown in 23%. Tumors in patients with blue or gray irises were less heavily pigmented (P<.001) and closer to the optic disc and macula (P<.001). Five- and 10-year metastasis-related death rates were 0.14 and 0.21, respectively, for those with blue or gray irises and 0.10 and 0.15, respectively, for those with darker irises (P = .02). In a Cox proportional hazards regression controlling for tumor characteristics, patients with blue or gray irises died of metastatic disease at a rate 1.90 times (95% confidence interval, 1.26-2.85) that of patients with brown irises. The rate of metastatic death was not significantly elevated for those with green or hazel irises (relative risk, 1.43; 95% confidence interval, 0.91-2.23). CONCLUSION: Patients with blue or gray irises appear to be at increased risk of metastatic death from choroidal melanoma, independent of other risk factors

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1987 and 1990, a pilot study (Protocol-1) was initially conducted in 16 patients to investigate the efficacy of chemoradiotherapy where RT was combined with TURB and continuous IA infusion of cisplatin. We then performed a regimen of possible bladder-preservation treatment (Protocol-2) in which 19 patients were treated with combination of TURB, full-dose RT and one-shot IA infusion of cisplatin and methotrexate. In RT small pelvis irradiation was performed with x-rays followed by proton beam boost irradiation to the original tumor site. RESULTS: Among patients treated on Protocol-1, a tumor-free bladder was observed in 50% (2/4) after 50-76 Gy but only 8% (1/14) after 30-40 Gy. In this regimen, planned cystectomy was performed in 10 patients and 13 patients (81%) are alive. Among 19 patients treated on Protocol-2, 17 patients (89%) are alive and 13 patients (68%) retained intact bladders without any recurrence. There were 3 cystectomies performed because of persistent tumors. Using a conformal mode of proton beam irradiation, a total dose of 60-80 Gy was safely administered with acceptable morbidities. CONCLUSION: In the light of good complete response and survival rates achieved in the patients treated on Protocol-2, the combined treatment of definitive RT and IA administration of chemotherapy is considered as an effective bladder-preserving strategy

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seven patients with acoustic neuromas deemed clinically suitable for linear accelerator or Gamma Knife radiosurgery were planned such that the minimum doses for any plan were equal. Gamma Knife plans were prepared in three ways: by altering the prescription of previously published data, by hand and with the assistance of an automatic planning algorithm (wizard). The linear accelerator plans were prepared utilizing a micro-multileaf collimator in both static and dynamic modes. The dose volume histogram analyses lead to a measure of conformity and the mean and minimum target dose for each plan. Statistical significance was calculated as each planning modality was compared with every other. RESULTS: All Gamma Knife plans demonstrated a statistically significantly better conformity when compared with fixed field linear accelerator techniques. When compared to linear accelerator techniques the wizard-assisted Gamma Knife plans demonstrated significantly better conformity. The mean target dose for all the Gamma Knife plans was significantly higher than that of the linear accelerator plans (19.2 Gy vs. 13.4 Gy). CONCLUSIONS: Conformity of the prescription isodose to the target shape is of major importance in radiosurgery. The modalities compared represent commercially available and widely accepted systems. Gamma Knife plans derived using the 'wizard' option and finalized by hand yield the best conformity. Copyright 2005 S. Karger AG, Basel	
0	1140	Treatment planning comparison of conventional, 3D conformal, and intensity-modulated photon (IMRT) and proton therapy for paranasal sinus carcinoma	Austria, Humans, Paranasal Sinus Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Paranasal Sinuses/ra [Radiography], Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Planning Techniques, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiobiology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Research, Risk, Tomography,X-Ray Computed	PURPOSE: To determine the potential improvements in patients with paranasal sinus carcinoma by comparing proton and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with conventional and conformal photon treatment planning techniques. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In 5 patients, comparative treatment planning was performed by comparing proton plans and related conventional, conformal, and IMRT photon plans. The evaluations analyzed dose-volume histogram findings of the target volumes and organs at risk (OARs, i.e., pituitary gland, optical pathway structures, brain, nontarget tissue). RESULTS: The mean and maximal doses, dose inhomogeneities, and conformity indexes for the planning target volumes were comparable for all techniques. Photon plans resulted in greater volumes of irradiated nontarget tissues at the 10-70% dose level compared with the corresponding proton plans. The volumes thereby increased by a factor of 1.3-3.1 for conventional, 1.1-3.8 for conformal, and 1.1-3.7 for IMRT. Compared with conventional techniques, conformal and IMRT photon treatment planning options similarly reduced the mean dose to the OARs. The use of protons further reduced the mean dose to the OARs by up to 65% and 62% compared with the conformal and IMRT technique, respectively. CONCLUSION: Compared with conventional treatment techniques, conformal RT and IMRT similarly enabled dose reductions to the OARs. Additional improvements were obtained using proton-based treatment planning modalities

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between December 1995 and December 1999, 17 patients received a treatment by 201-MeV proton beam at the Centre de Protontherapie d'Orsay (CPO) for a meningioma. Five patients presented a histologically atypical or malignant meningioma, twelve patients a benign one that was recurrent or rapidly progressive. In two cases radiotherapy was administered in the initial course of the disease and in 15 cases at the time of relapse. A highly conformal approach was used combining high-energy photons and protons for approximately 2/3 and 1/3 of the total dose. The median total dose delivered within gross tumor volume was 61 Cobalt Gray Equivalent CGE (25-69). RESULTS: Median follow-up was 37 months (17-60). The 4-year local control and overall survival rates were 87.5 +/- 12% and 88.9 +/- 11%, respectively. One patient failed locally within the clinical tumor volume. One patient died of intercurrent disease. A complete or partial clinical improvement was seen in most of patients. Radiologically, there were eleven stable diseases and five partial responses. In 12/15 recurrent cases, the free interval after radiotherapy is longer than that achieved by the initial surgery. This radiotherapy was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: In both benign and more aggressive meningiomas, the combination of conformal photons and protons with a dose escalated by 10-15% offers clinical improvements in most patients as well as radiological long-term stabilization	
1	4043	Comparison of survival rates for patients with uveal melanoma after treatment with proton beam irradiation or enucleation	Adult, Aged, Female, Humans, Male, Melanoma, Melanoma/mo [Mortality], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Melanoma/sc [Secondary], Melanoma/su [Surgery], Middle Aged, Ophthalmologic Surgical Procedures, Protons, Research, Survival, Survival Rate, Uveal Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Uveal Neoplasms/su [Surgery]	We compared survival experiences for three groups with uveal melanoma: (1) 120 patients treated by proton beam irradiation from 1975 to 1981; (2) 235 patients treated by enucleation from 1953 to 1973 (enucleation group 1); and (3) 161 patients treated by enucleation from 1975 to 1981 (enucleation group 2). The following variables were predictive of melanoma-related deaths. Treatment: rate ratio (ratio of the rate of death for one category of the variable relative to the rate of death for another category) of 6.32 (95% confidence interval 1.70 to 23.51) for enucleation group 1 vs proton beam, 3.06 (0.81 to 11.54) for enucleation group 2 vs proton beam, and 2.07 (1.05 to 4.07) for enucleation group 1 vs enucleation group 2. Size: rate ratio of 3.61 (1.51 to 8.64) for large (16+ mm) vs small (less than 11 mm) tumors. Location: rate ratio of 3.19 (1.56 to 6.53) for tumors anterior vs posterior to the equator. When death from all causes was evaluated as the outcome, the estimated rate ratios were similar. When melanoma metastasis was evaluated as the outcome, the estimated rate ratios were reduced in magnitude	
0	3108	Comparative treatment planning between proton and X-ray therapy in locally advanced rectal cancer	Aged, Female, Head, Humans, Male, Methods, Middle Aged, Models,Biological, Protons, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Rectal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Research, Risk, Sweden, Universities, X-Ray Therapy, X-Rays	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Conformal treatment planning with megavoltage X-rays and protons for medically inoperable patients with a large rectal cancer has been studied in an attempt to determine if there are advantages of using protons instead of X-rays. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Three dose plans were made for each of the six patients: one proton plan, including three beams covering the primary tumour and adjacent lymph nodes and three boost beams covering the primary tumour: one X-ray plan, eight beams including a boost with four beams and one mixed plan with four X-ray beams and a boost with three proton beams. A three dimensional treatment-planning systems, TMS, was used. The evaluation of the different plans was made by applying the biological models TCP and NTCP on the dose distributions in terms of dose-volume histograms. RESULTS: The comparison shows advantages of using protons instead of X-rays for all six patients, but in three of them, the advantage is only marginal. The dose-limiting organ at risk is the small bowel, but the proton plan and the mixed plan also spare the bladder and the femoral heads better. At 5% NTCP in any risk organ, the calculated mean TCP value for the six patients is increased by 14%-units with the proton plan and 8%-units with the mixed plan compared to X-rays only. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy has potential advantages when treating medically inoperable patients with a large rectal cancer over conventional X-ray therapy. Since the benefits are comparatively small, although clinically worthwhile, large randomised studies are needed

METHODS: Two patients initially diagnosed and treated for unilateral scleritis were referred for management of persistent inflammation. Additional evaluation uncovered underlying malignant processes. RESULTS: The first patient presented with scleritis initially responsive to systemic corticosteroids, with relapse one month later. Upon referral, peripheral fundus examination revealed elevated lesions. Additional studies confirmed the diagnosis of choroidal melanoma. The patient was treated with proton-beam irradiation. The second patient developed necrotizing scleritis unresponsive to systemic steroids, methotrexate, and cyclophosphamide. A scleral biopsy disclosed an undifferentiated high-grade carcinoma, likely metastatic. Exenteration was performed. CONCLUSIONS: Scleritis can present a diagnostic challenge. It is often the sole initial manifestation of an occult systemic problem. Treatment-resistant scleritis should raise the suspicion of an infectious or malignant masquerade

Proton beam therapy has been advocated by Zografos and associates as optimal for treating these tumours in this critical region as charged particles have a highly localised and uniform dose distribution. PATIENTS: We present 3 cases of CCH treated with proton beam therapy. Two patients developed radiation optic neuropathy and maculopathy, and one had a persistent exudative macular detachment following treatment. CONCLUSION: Our experience with proton therapy of these tumours has been disappointing in preventing radiation optic neuropathy and maculopathy and offers little advantage over external irradiation. The majority of our patients with this condition are now treated with low-dose lens-sparing external beam radiotherapy or brachytherapy, which has encouraging visual results and is a far more cost-effective option

RT consisted of 3600 to 4500 cGy external pelvic treatments on a 6-MeV linear accelerator followed by two intracavitary applications administering a total of 4000 mg hr of radium equivalent cesium. CT consisted of a course of mitomycin C (10 mg/m2 iv bolus) and 5-fluorouracil (5FU; 1000 mg/m2/24 hr for 96 hr) during the second week of external RT and another course of cis-platinum (CDDP; 75 mg/m2, 1-6 hr infusion) and 5FU (1000 mg/m2/24 hr for 96 hr) during the first intracavitary cesium application. Toxicity was acceptable and complete clinical response was obtained in all patients at the end of the regimen. Nine patients are alive (eight without disease) 6 to 37 months following initiation of treatment (median 20 months). One patient has developed lumbar spine bone metastases and another died of local and pulmonary disease at 28 months. This combination of 5FU/mitomycin C/CDDP and RT appears to be a practical, well-tolerated, and highly effective regimen for advanced cervical carcinoma

The particles utilized have included helium, primarily of interest because of improved dose distributions with reduction of dose to adjacent normal tissues, and heavier particles such as carbon, neon and argon ions which have the additional potential of increased biologic effectiveness against the tumor, especially hypoxic tumor cells. Initial results with helium particles have been sufficiently good to warrant a Phase III randomized trial in carcinoma of the pancreas; in other tumor sites, and with other particles, Phase I -- Phase II studies are in progress. Although follow-up is short, control within the irradiated area in this heterogeneous group of patients appears at least as good as with current megavoltage irradiation and complications to date are acceptably low, warranting further studies with heavy charged particles

The symptoms may subside spontaneously, but often persist. Treatment is usually by local injection of a corticosteroid, orthopedic devices or other standard treatment. If these methods fail, X-ray treatment may be considered. The efficacy of radiotherapy of the calcaneal spur was evaluated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From April 1981 through December 1991, 18 patients with painful heel were irradiated mostly with the caesium or telecobalt unit, usually with a dose of 4 times 0.5 Gy. Among these patients, 12 could be followed up during a prolonged period on the basis of questionnaires. RESULTS: According to the categories of v. Pannewitz 17% of the patients were pain-free by the end of the treatment course, 22% showed marked improvement, 33% showed improvement and in 28% the pain was not influenced. Over an average of 41.5 months 58% of the patients reported freedom from pain. CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose radiotherapy appears to relieve the painful heel syndrome in a high proportion of patients. The overall treatment risk appears to be very small. The mechanism of low-dose radiotherapy is unknown	
1	2643	Anterior segment sparing to reduce charged particle radiotherapy complications in uveal melanoma	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Analysis of Variance, Anterior Eye Segment, California, Californium, Eye, Eye Enucleation, Female, Glaucoma,Neovascular/et [Etiology], Helium, Helium/ae [Adverse Effects], Helium/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Male, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Methods, Middle Aged, Multivariate Analysis, Probability, Protons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Research, Risk, Risk Factors, Universities, Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	PURPOSE: The purpose of this investigation is to delineate the risk factors in the development of neovascular glaucoma (NVG) after helium-ion irradiation of uveal melanoma patients and to propose treatment technique that may reduce this risk. METHODS AND MATERIALS: 347 uveal melanoma patients were treated with helium-ions using a single-port treatment technique. Using univariate and multivariate statistics, the NVG complication rate was analyzed according to the percent of anterior chamber in the radiation field, tumor size, tumor location, sex, age, dose, and other risk factors. Several University of California San Francisco-Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) patients in each size category (medium, large, and extralarge) were retrospectively replanned using two ports instead of a single port. By using appropriate polar and azimuthal gaze angles or by treating patients with two ports, the maximum dose to the anterior segment of the eye can often be reduced. Although a larger volume of anterior chamber may receive a lower dose by using two ports than a single port treatment. We hypothesize that this could reduce the level of complications that result from the irradiation of the anterior chamber of the eye. Dose-volume histograms were calculated for the lens, and compared for the single and two-port techniques. RESULTS: NVG developed in 121 (35%) patients. The risk of NVG peaked between 1 and 2.5 years posttreatment. By univariate and multivariate analysis, the percent of lens in the field was strongly correlated with the development of NVG. Other contributing factors were tumor height, history of diabetes, and vitreous hemorrhage. Dose-volume histogram analysis of single-port vs. two-port techniques demonstrate that for some patients in the medium and large category tumor groups, a significant decrease in dose to the structures in the anterior segment of the eye could have been achieved with the use of two ports. CONCLUSION: The development of NVG after helium-ion irradiation is correlated to the amount of lens, anterior chamber in the treatment field, tumor height, proximity to the fovea, history of diabetes, and the development of vitreous hemorrhage. Although the influence of the higher LET deposition of helium-ions is unclear, this study suggests that by reducing the dose to the anterior segment of the eye may reduce the NVG complications. Based on this retrospective analysis of LBNL patients, we have implemented techniques to reduce the amount of the anterior segment receiving a high dose in our new series of patients treated with protons using the cyclotron at the UC Davis Crocker Nuclear Laboratory (CNL)

Helium ion treatment of tumors adjacent to critical central nervous system structures	Aged, Brain, Brain Stem, Chondrosarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Chordoma, Chordoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Helium, Humans, Immobilization, Ions, Meningeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Meningioma/rt [Radiotherapy], Methods, Middle Aged, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Risk, Skull, Skull Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Spinal Cord, Spinal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	In this paper we present a technique for treating relatively small, low grade tumors located very close to critical, radiation sensitive central nervous system structures such as the spinal cord and the brain stem. A beam of helium ions is used to irradiate the tumor. The nearby normal tissues are protected by exploiting the superb dose localization properties of this beam, particularly its well defined and controllable range in tissue, the increased dose deposited near the end of this range (i.e., the Bragg peak), the sharp decrease in dose beyond the Bragg peak, and the sharp penumbra of the beam. To execute this type of treatment, extreme care must be taken in localization of the tumor and normal tissues, as well as in treatment planning and dosimetry, patient immobilization, and verification of treatment delivery. To illustrate the technique, we present a group of 19 patients treated for chordomas, meningiomas and low grade chondrosarcomas in the base of the skull or spinal column. We have been able to deliver high, uniform doses to the target volumes (doses equivalent to 60 to 80 Gy of cobalt-60) while keeping the doses to the nearby critical tissues below the threshold for radiation damage. Follow-up on this group of patients is short, averaging 22 months (2 to 75 months). Currently, 15 patients have local control of their tumor. Two major complications, a spinal cord transection and optic tract damage, are discussed in detail. Our treatment policies have been modified to minimize the risk of these complications in the future, and we are continuing to use this method to treat such patients. We are enthusiastic about this technique, since we believe there is no other potentially curative treatment for these patients	
0	2994	Preliminary clinical experience with linear accelerator-based spinal stereotactic radiosurgery	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Animals, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Immobilization, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Middle Aged, Neurosurgery/td [Trends], Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/is [Instrumentation], Research, Spinal Cord, Spinal Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Spinal Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Spinal Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Spine/pa [Pathology], Spine/ra [Radiography], Spine/su [Surgery], Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Universities	A prototype device called an extracranial stereotactic radiosurgery frame was used to deliver stereotactic radiosurgery, with a modified linear accelerator, to metastatic neoplasms in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar regions in five patients. In all patients, the neoplasms had failed to respond to spinal cord tolerance doses delivered by standard external fractionated radiation therapy to a median dose of 45 Gy (range, 33-65 Gy/11-30 fractions). The tumors were treated with single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery with the spinal stereotactic frame for immobilization, localization, and treatment. The median number of isocenters was one (range, one to five) with a median single fraction dose of 10 Gy (range, 8-10 Gy) with median normalization to 80% isodose contour (range, 80-160%). There has been a single complication of esophagitis to date from radiosurgery of a tumor involving the C6-T1 segments; the esophagitis resolved with medical therapy. Median follow-up in this group of patients has been 6 months (range, 1-12 mo). To date, there has been no radiographic or clinical progression of the treated tumor in any patient. Two patients have died from systemic metastatic disease. In the three surviving patients, there has been computed tomographic- or magnetic resonance-documented regression of the treated tumor with a decrease of thecal sac compression with a median follow-up of 6 months (range, 3-14 mo). These five patients represent the first clinical application of stereotactic radiosurgery in the spine. The results suggest that extracranial radiosurgery may be suitable for the treatment of paraspinal neoplasms after external fractionated radiation therapy, even in the face of spinal cord compression

PATIENTS AND METHOD: Between September 1991 and August 1997, 27 patients (13 female, 14 male) underwent fractionated proton radiation therapy for progressive or recurrent low-grade astrocytoma. Age at time of treatment ranged from 2 to 18 years (mean: 8.7 years). Tumors were located centrally (diencephalic) in 15 patients, in the cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres in seven patients, and in the brainstem in five patients. 25/27 patients (92%) were treated for progressive, unresectable, or residual disease following subtotal resection. Tissue diagnosis was available in 23/27 patients (85%). Four patients with optic pathway tumors were treated without histologic confirmation. Target doses between 50.4 and 63.0 CGE (Cobalt Gray Equivalent, mean: 55.2 CGE) were prescribed at 1.8 CGE per fraction, five treatments per week. RESULTS: At a mean follow-up period of 3.3 years (0.6-6.8 years), 6/27 patients experienced local failure (all located within the irradiated field), and 4/27 patients had died. By anatomic site these data translated into rates of local control and survival of 87% (13/15 patients) and 93% (14/15 patients) for central tumors, 71% (5/7 patients) and 86% (6/7 patients) for hemispheric tumors, and 60% (3/5 patients) and 60% (3/5 patients) for tumors located in the brainstem. Proton radiation therapy was generally well tolerated. All children with local control maintained their performance status. One child with associated neurofibromatosis, Type 1, developed Moyamoya disease. All six patients with optic pathway tumors and useful vision maintained or improved their visual status. CONCLUSIONS: This report on pediatric low-grade astrocytomas confirms proton radiation therapy as a safe and efficacious 3-D conformal treatment modality. Results are encouraging for central tumors as well as large optic pathway tumors, where dose conformity is of particular importance; yet it is difficult to achieve. Longer follow-up time is needed to fully evaluate the benefits of normal tissue sparing

Local control has been achieved for all patients (with, however, one marginal failure) with a follow-up period ranging from 2 months to 6 years. High doses of radiation, up to 76 Cobalt Gray Equivalents (CGE), have been delivered without significant morbidity. In particular, no neurological sequelae have been observed

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Sixty-five patients with cervical cancer (Stage I-IV) treated by irradiation were included in the study. Among the 65 cases, 2 were in Stage I, 13 in Stage II, 40 in Stage III, and 10 in Stage IV. Patients who received surgical resection were excluded. Thirty-nine patients received BOAI and 44 received brachytherapy. Twenty-six patients were not indicated for BOAI because of insufficient renal function, hepatic complications, hematological complications, and refusal from the patients. Cisplatin (0.9-1.7 mg/kg), Adriamycin (0.7-0.9 mg/kg), and Pepleomycin (0.4-0.6 mg/kg) were administered simultaneously into the bilateral internal iliac arteries by BOAI. External irradiation was given by 10 MV x-ray. Total dose administered to the regional lymph nodes by the external irradiation was 48.3 +/- 8.7 Gy. Radium was used at brachytherapy. The dose delivered by the brachytherapy at point A was 45.3 +/- 14.9 Gy. Patients without brachytherapy received 26.1 +/- 19.1 Gy of boost irradiation by the external photon beam. The survival probabilities of the patients were calculated by Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: The 5-year survival rates of the Stage III patients with and without BOAI were 53 +/- 13% and 24 +/- 18%, respectively (p = 0.036). By multivariate analyses using Cox's proportional hazard model, stage and BOAI were selected as significant predictors of the prognosis. Transient bone marrow suppression was observed in about half of the patients with BOAI. No significant increase of the incidence of the late radiation damage by BOAI in rectum or in urinary bladder was observed. CONCLUSION: Balloon occluded arterial infusion of anticancer drugs may improve the prognosis of the patients with cervical cancer without increasing the incidence of the late radiation damage. A larger scale prospective randomized study is desired

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Four hundred and twenty-one cases of NPC, treated in the Cancer Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University of Medical Sciences (SUMS), with computed tomography scanning before initial radiotherapy, are analyzed. Important prognostic factors that form the basis of the new staging system are screened out by means of Cox model and clinical experiences. Survival curves of various kinds of T and N stages are compared by computer simulation. A new staging system is proposed by studying the traditional staging systems such as the AJC, UICC, Ho's and Changsha systems. RESULTS: According to the new staging criteria, the 5-year survival rates for Stages I-IV are 89.7%, 75.9%, 51.3%, and 22.2%, respectively. CONCLUSION: This new clinical staging for NPC based on a large amount of cases multivariate analysis is satisfactory and widely used in China

After treatment by heavy ion beam therapy, pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy was performed. The tumor was pT3, pN0, pM0, stage IIA. Sixteen months after the surgery, the patient was admitted to the hospital because he was vomiting blood. Hemorrhaging caused by failure of the cut end of the gastroduodenal artery into the elevated jejunum was confirmed by angiogram, and the hemorrhaging could be stopped by a transcatheter arterial embolization operation. Twenty-four months after surgery, the patient was readmitted because he was once again vomiting blood. Hemorrhaging from the elevated jejunum was suspected by hemorrhagic scintigram, but the source could not be identified on further examination, and the choice of treatment was difficult. The patient died on the 9th day after admittance to the hospital. Even on examination at autopsy, the source of the hemorrhaging could not be identified. No recurrence of cancer could be found. This has proven to be a perplexing case, in that hemorrhaging from the end of the routinely cut gastroduodenal artery occurred 16 and 24 months after heavy ion beam therapy and pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy for pancreatic cancer

At the National Institute of Radiological Sciences, patient treatment with the 70 MeV proton beam began in November 1979, and 29 patients were treated through December 1984. Of 11 patients who received protons only, 9 have had local control of the tumor. Two of the 9 patients, suffering from recurrent tumor after radical photon beam irradiation, developed complications after proton treatment. In the patients treated with photons or neutrons followed by proton boost, tumors were controlled in 12 of 18 patients (66.6%), and no complications were observed in this series. Malignant melanoma could not be controlled with the proton beam. A spot-beam-scanning system for protons has been effectively used in the clinical trials to minimize the dose to the normal tissues and to concentrate the dose in the target volume. At the Particle Radiation Medical Science Center, University of Tsukuba, treatment with a vertical 250 MeV proton beam was begun in April 1983, and 22 patients were treated through February 1984. Local control of the tumor was observed in 14 of 22 patients (63.6%), whereas there was no local control in the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme. There have been no severe complications in patients treated at PARMS. The results suggest that local control of tumors will be better with proton beams than with photon beams, whereas additional modalities are required to manage radioresistant tumors	
1	2509	A phase I-II trial of heavy charged particle irradiation of malignant glioma of the brain: a Northern California Oncology Group Study	Adult, Astrocytoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Brain, Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], California, Californium, Carbon, Combined Modality Therapy, Energy Transfer, Glioma/rt [Radiotherapy], Helium, Humans, Middle Aged, Neon, Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Survival, Universities	Thirty-nine patients with primary or recurrent glioma of the brain were irradiated wholely or in part with heavy charged particle beams at the University of California Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in a Phase I-II clinical trial of the Northern California Oncology Group. During the course of this trial, treatment techniques have been developed and tumor doses have been escalated in order to obtain data on normal brain toxicity and response of malignant glioma of the brain. Toxicity has been acceptable with a low level of brain injury. Survival and tumor control has been approximately the same as historical results in glioma of the brain. Further dose escalation is planned together with possible trial of combined modality therapy	
1	4303	A dual computed tomography linear accelerator unit for stereotactic radiation therapy: a new approach without cranially fixated stereotactic frames	Brain, Brain Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Brain Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Brain Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Equipment Design, Head, Humans, Japan, Methods, Motion, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Time, Tomography,X-Ray Computed	PURPOSE: To perform stereotactic radiation therapy (SRT) without cranially fixated stereotactic frames, we developed a dual computed tomography (CT) linear accelerator (linac) treatment unit. METHODS AND MATERIALS: This unit is composed of a linac, CT, and motorized table. The linac and CT are set up at opposite ends of the table, which is suitable for both machines. The gantry axis of the linac is coaxial with that of the CT scanner. Thus, the center of the target detected with the CT can be matched easily with the gantry axis of the linac by rotating the table. Positioning is confirmed with the CT for each treatment session. Positioning and treatment errors with this unit were examined by phantom studies. Between August and December 1994, 8 patients with 11 lesions of primary or metastatic brain tumors received SRT with this unit. All lesions were treated with 24 Gy in three fractions to 30 Gy in 10 fractions to the 80% isodose line, with or without conventional external beam radiation therapy. RESULTS: Phantom studies revealed that treatment errors with this unit were within 1 mm after careful positioning. The position was easily maintained using two tiny metallic balls as vertical and horizontal marks. Motion of patients was negligible using a conventional heat-flexible head mold and dental impression. The overall time for a multiple noncoplanar arcs treatment for a single isocenter was less than 1 h on the initial treatment day and usually less than 20 min on subsequent days. Treatment was outpatient-based and well tolerated with no acute toxicities. Satisfactory responses have been documented. CONCLUSION: Using this treatment unit, multiple fractionated SRT is performed easily and precisely without cranially fixated stereotactic frames

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The FOCAL unit is a combination of a linear accelerator (Linac), CT scanner, X-ray simulator (X-S), and carbon table, and is designed to achieve CT-guided SRT with daily CT positioning followed by immediate irradiation while patients keep reduced shallow respirations. To evaluate intrafractional tumor position stability, 50 lung or liver lesions in 20 patients were checked by repeated CT scanning just before and after irradiation, and the obtained images were compared. RESULTS: There was no case with the intrafractional error judged to be greater than 10 mm. In 68% of cases, the intrafractional positioning errors were negligible (0-5 mm). CONCLUSIONS: Using the FOCAL unit, SRT for lung or liver cancers could be performed with intrafractional positioning errors not greater than 10 mm

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of all patients between 1990 and 2005 with the diagnosis of bladder and prostate cancer was performed. Of 125 total patients new onset urothelial carcinoma developed in 11 after undergoing external beam radiation therapy for prostate cancer. RESULTS: Whole pelvis external beam radiation therapy with a proton boost to the prostate was the radiation modality in 7 of the 11 patients (64%), while the remaining 4 patients received standard external beam radiation only. Urothelial carcinoma was detected a mean of 3.07 years after completion of radiation therapy in the proton group, compared to a mean latency period of 5.75 years in the standard radiation group (p = 0.09). Average patient age at diagnosis was 72 years (range 64 to 84). All patients presented with gross hematuria and had cystoscopic findings of coexisting radiation cystitis. Of the 11 patients 5 (45%) presented with grade 3 carcinoma and eventually 7 (64%) required radical cystectomy. Urothelial tumors with sarcomatoid features (carcinosarcoma and spindle cell sarcomatoid) developed in 2 patients (18%). Of the 11 patients 10 (91%) were nonsmokers at the time of urothelial carcinoma diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Urothelial carcinoma in patients with previous radiation therapy for prostate cancer is often high grade, and the majority of patients have cancer progression requiring cystectomy. A high incidence of urothelial carcinoma with sarcomatoid features was seen in these patients	
0	4077	Definitive proton beam radiation therapy for inoperable gastric cancer: a report of two cases	Adenocarcinoma, Adenocarcinoma/pa [Pathology], Adenocarcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Aged, Aged,80 and over, Biopsy, Humans, Japan, Male, Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Skin, Stomach Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Stomach Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Stomach Ulcer/di [Diagnosis], Stomach Ulcer/pa [Pathology], Stomach/pa [Pathology], Universities	Proton beam radiation therapy using 250 MeV protons was carried out on two patients with early gastric cancer (T1, N0, M0). One patient was an 85-year-old man with early gastric cancer of type IIa + IIc. The other one was a 70 year old man with early gastric cancer of type IIc. In both cases histological examination of biopsy specimens showed differentiated adenocarcinoma; distant metastasis was not found by other examinations. Both patients were considered inoperable due to their poor cardiac and/or respiratory functions. Therefore, it was decided to treat them by definitive proton irradiation, delivering total doses of 86 Gy and 83 Gy, respectively. In both patients, skin erythema that did not require any special treatment was found in the irradiation field. Hematobiological examinations did not show any abnormality. Although endoscopic examination at two years after irradiation in the former case and at seven months in the latter case showed persistent gastric ulcer at the site of the cancerous lesions, cancer cells were not found histologically. Therefore, we concluded that proton irradiation therapy was useful for inoperable early gastric cancers	
0	1627	Effects of proton and combined proton/photon beam radiation on pulmonary function in patients with resectable but medically inoperable non-small cell lung cancer	Aged, Aged,80 and over, Carbon, Carcinoma,Non-Small-Cell Lung/pa [Pathology], Carcinoma,Non-Small-Cell Lung/rt [Radiotherapy], Carcinoma,Non-Small-Cell Lung/su [Surgery], Cobalt, Combined Modality Therapy, Diffusion, Dose Fractionation, Female, Germany, Humans, Lung, Lung Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Lung Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Lung Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Male, Middle Aged, Neoadjuvant Therapy, Neoplasm Staging, Photons, Protons, Radiation, Respiratory Function Tests, Universities	STUDY OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the effects on pulmonary function of irradiating lung cancer with protons alone or protons combined with photons. DESIGN: Prospective phase I/II study. SETTING: University medical center. PATIENTS AND INTERVENTIONS: Ten patients with stage I-II non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and FEV(1) < or = 1.0 L were irradiated with protons to areas of gross disease only, using 51 cobalt gray equivalents (CGE) in 10 fractions (protocol 1). Fifteen patients with stage I-IIIA NSCLC and FEV(1) > 1.0 L received 45-Gy photon irradiation to the primary lung tumor and the mediastinum, plus a 28.8-CGE proton boost to the gross tumor volume (protocol 2). MEASUREMENTS: Pulmonary function was evaluated prior to treatment and 1 month, 3 months, and 6 to 12 months following irradiation. RESULTS: In patients receiving protocol 1, no significant changes in pulmonary function occurred. In patients receiving protocol 2, at 6 to 12 months, the diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide had declined from 61% of predicted to 45% of predicted (p < 0.05), total lung capacity had declined from 114% of predicted to 95% of predicted (p < 0.05), and residual volume had declined from 160% of predicted to 132% of predicted (p < 0.05). Airway resistance increased from 3.8 to 5.2 cm H(2)O/L/s (p < 0.05). No statistically significant changes occurred in vital capacity, FEV(1), or PaO(2). CONCLUSIONS: Our observations indicate that it is feasible to apply higher-than-conventional doses of radiation at a higher-than-conventional dose per fraction without excess pulmonary toxicity when conformal radiation techniques with protons are used	
1	163	Survival implications of enucleation after definitive radiotherapy for choroidal melanoma: an example of regression on time-dependent covariates	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Choroid Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Choroid Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Choroid Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Cobalt Radioisotopes, Cobalt Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Cohort Studies, Dose Fractionation, Eye Enucleation, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Melanoma/mo [Mortality], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Melanoma/su [Surgery], Middle Aged, Proportional Hazards Models, Prospective Studies, Protons, Radiotherapy, Regression Analysis, Survival Rate, Time Factors, Treatment Failure	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether the removal of the eye after radiotherapy alters the rates of metastatic death in patients with melanoma of the choroid. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using an extension of the Cox model, we based our analysis on a cohort of 1541 consecutive patients with unilateral choroidal or ciliary body melanoma treated with protons (70 cobalt-gray equivalent in 5 to 7 fractions) at the Harvard University (Boston, Mass) cyclotron between July 1, 1975, through December 31, 1993, and who were observed prospectively up to September 30, 1995. Patient survival and the status of the treated eye were updated annually. RESULTS: By September 1995 (median follow-up among survivors, 8 years), 137 patients underwent enucleation after radiotherapy for complications (n=103) or tumor regrowth (n=34). The overall 10-year rate of eye retention was 89% (95% confidence interval, 87%-91%). Of the 1541 patients, 300 died of tumor metastasis, 38 following enucleation of the affected eye (mean interval from enucleation to death, 25 months). The multivariate rate ratio for metastatic death associated with enucleation (modeled as a time-dependent covariate) was 0.9 (95% confidence interval, 0.6-1.4) for enucleation due to complications and 3.8 (95% confidence interval, 2.3-6.3) for enucleation associated with tumor regrowth. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of tumor viability, enucleation after primary irradiation for choroidal melanoma has no deleterious effect on patients' survival. Enucleation concurrent with tumor regrowth is associated with high death rates; growth of the tumor in the eye may presage systemic recurrence and death from metastasis	
1	2365	Charged particle irradiation of chordoma and chondrosarcoma of the base of skull and cervical spine: the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory experience	Actuarial Analysis, Adult, Biophysics, California, Californium, Cervical Vertebrae, Chondrosarcoma/mo [Mortality], Chondrosarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Chordoma/mo [Mortality], Chordoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Photons, Radiation, Radiation Injuries, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research, Skull, Skull Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Skull Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Spinal Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Spinal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Survival, Universities	Forty-five consecutive patients with chordoma or chondrosarcoma at the base of skull or cervical spine were treated at the University of California Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (UCLBL) and University of California School of Medicine, San Francisco (UCSF) between November 1977 and October 1986. All patients had undergone a subtotal surgical resection. Twenty-three patients were treated definitively with charged particles, 13 patients were treated with photons and particles, and 9 patients were treated for recurrent disease. Total doses ranged from 36 to 80 Gray equivalent (GyE). Thirty-three patients are alive with a minimum followup of 1 year. The actuarial survival and local control for all patients at 5 years is 62% and 59%, respectively. Patients treated for primary disease had a 78% actuarial local control rate at 2 years, whereas the rate for patients with recurrent disease was 33%. Patients with smaller visible tumor volumes (less than 20 cc) had a significantly better local control rate than patients with larger tumor volumes (80% vs 33% actuarial rate at 5 years). Patients with chondrosarcoma had the highest local control rate, as did patients treated with particles alone. Complications included 3 patients with unilateral visual loss, two patients who became blind, and 4 patients with radiation injury to the brainstem	
0	989	Comparison of different external beam treatment techniques to deliver high-dose irradiation to local recurrent rectal carcinoma	Aged, Carcinoma/pa [Pathology], Carcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Female, Humans, Italy, Male, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/pa [Pathology], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/rt [Radiotherapy], Prone Position, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Rectal Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Rectal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Treatment Outcome	AIMS AND BACKGROUND: Treatment of local-regional recurrent rectal carcinoma is a challenging problem, and local control may be dose dependent; doses should probably exceed 60 Gy. Our aim was to verify the possibility to deliver 66 Gy to the target, but less than 35 Gy to the small bowel, comparing different 3D irradiation techniques, in a selected group of patients. METHODS: Five patients with local recurrent rectal carcinoma were selected as representative of different presentations of the disease. Gross tumor volume and clinical target volume were defined [by RS]. Tumors ranged between 182 and 540 cc, and small bowel volumes between 748 and 1050 cc. A three-field technique, coplanar multiple fields, noncoplanar fields and a proton beam were compared using dose volume histograms. A positive result was scored when > or = 90% of the target received the prescribed dose with no more than 5% of the small bowel receiving more than 35 Gy. Doses were escalated in steps of 2 Gy from 60 to 66 Gy. RESULTS: The number of plans fitting the constraints were 7/19, 11/19, 18/19 for doses of 66 Gy, 64 Gy and 62 Gy, respectively. The stage of the tumor did not seem to correlate with the possibility to homogeneously cover the target with the prescribed dose. CONCLUSIONS: Simple coplanar and complex coplanar techniques (up to six fields), positioning the patient in a prone position with dislocation of the bowel, seem to be the best solutions to treat almost all of the patients with doses of 64 Gy. Where higher doses are concerned, it is not possible to suggest a "standard" solution. More personalized techniques have to be tested to define the best option	
0	1996	Nasopharyngeal carcinoma: repeat treatment with conformal proton therapy--dose-volume histogram analysis	Adult, Aged, Disease-Free Survival, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/mo [Mortality], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/rt [Radiotherapy], Photons, Prognosis, Protons, Radiation, Recurrence, Survival, Survival Rate, Universities	PURPOSE: To analyze control, survival, and complication rates of conformal proton radiation for recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixteen patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma initially treated with 50.0-88.2 Gy photons were re-treated with protons to additional doses of 59.4-70.2 CGE. Local-regional control and survival were correlated with extent of relapse, recurrence versus persistence, and prescribed dose and were subjected to dose-volume histogram analysis. Mean follow-up was 23.7 months (range, 4-47 months). RESULTS: Twenty-four-month actuarial overall and local-regional progression-free survival rates were both 50%. The 24-month actuarial overall survival rates for patients with "optimal" dose-volume histogram coverage versus "suboptimal" coverage were 83% and 17%, respectively (P = .006). Doses to critical structures were low (0-22.0 Gy); no central nervous system side effects supervened. CONCLUSION: Adequate tumor coverage, as evaluated by using dose-volume histogram analysis, was found to be the most important variable influencing local-regional control and survival. No central nervous system complications were observed; increases in the dose to adjacent critical structures are being evaluated	
0	2998	Efficacy of proton therapy in circumscribed choroidal hemangiomas associated with serious retinal detachment	Adult, Aged, Angiography, Choroid Neoplasms/co [Complications], Choroid Neoplasms/pp [Physiopathology], Choroid Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Exudates and Transudates, Eye, Female, Fluorescein Angiography, Follow-Up Studies, France, Fundus Oculi, Hemangioma/co [Complications], Hemangioma/pp [Physiopathology], Hemangioma/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Intraocular Pressure, Male, Middle Aged, Pressure, Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Retinal Detachment/co [Complications], Retinal Detachment/pp [Physiopathology], Retrospective Studies, Safety, Ultrasonography, Visual Acuity	OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of proton therapy in complicated circumscribed choroidal hemangiomas. DESIGN: The study design was a retrospective review. PARTICIPANTS: Studied were 13 patients (13 eyes) who had circumscribed choroidal hemangioma associated with serous retinal detachment. Of these, four eyes previously underwent laser unsuccessfully. INTERVENTION: Proton therapy including a total dose of 30 Cobalt-Gray-Equivalent was administered to each eye. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patients were controlled for initial and final best-corrected visual acuity, slit-lamp examination, intraocular pressure, fundus examination, fluorescein angiography, and tumor thickness on B-scan ultrasonography. RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 26 months (range, 9-48 months). Retinal reattachment was obtained in all cases after a mean period of 52 days. The tumor height decreased in all cases. Visual acuity improved to two lines or more in eight eyes (62%) and reached 20/200 or more in nine eyes (69%). No radiation complication was detected during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Proton radiation seems to be effective and safe in the management of choroidal hemangioma associated with serous retinal detachment. It may be useful when photocoagulation can not be performed

Overall survival, local control, complications, and predictive parameters are analyzed. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fourteen patients with sacral chordomas were treated with the charged particles helium and neon between 1977 and 1989. The median dose was 7565 cGyE and the median follow up is 5 years. All patients were treated post-operatively; ten had gross residual disease. RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier survival at 5 years is 85%. Overall 5-year local control is 55%. A trend to improved local control at 5 years was seen in patients treated with neon when compared to patients treated with helium (62% vs 34%), in patients following complete resection versus patients with gross residual tumor (75% vs 40%), and in patients who had treatment courses under 73 days (61% vs 21%). Distant metastases were seen in two patients (14%). No patient developed neurologic sequelae or pain syndromes. One previously irradiated patient required colostomy, one patient had delayed wound healing following a negative post-radiation biopsy, and one patient developed a second malignancy. There were no genitourinary complications. CONCLUSION: Our experience indicates that post-operative charged particle irradiation of sacral chordomas appears to result in reasonable local control and survival with acceptable risk, and that additional evaluation on the use of heavy charged particles is warranted

Since April 1987 67 patients have been treated of which twelve have been included in a randomized study on head and neck cancer and 40 on pelvic cancer. The clinical treatment planning is presented in detail and discussed. The results presented are considered to be very preliminary, so that no attempt has been made to analyse and discuss them in detail	
0	1920	Evaluation of the effect of high-energy proton irradiation treatment on meningiomas by means of 11C-L-methionine PET	Adult, Aged, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Meningioma/pa [Pathology], Meningioma/ri [Radionuclide Imaging], Meningioma/rt [Radiotherapy], Methionine/du [Diagnostic Use], Middle Aged, Protons, Radioactivity, Radiopharmaceuticals, Radiopharmaceuticals/du [Diagnostic Use], Radiotherapy, Recurrence, Sweden, Tomography,Emission-Computed, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Universities	A remnant meningioma of WHO grade I that is located at the base of the skull and is treated with radiotherapy has to be followed up for at least 5-10 years to evaluate the treatment effect and detect recurrence. The tumour has to grow considerably to show detectable volume increase on computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Owing to the location at the base of the skull, a small increase in tumour volume may be hazardous. It is thus important to find a method to evaluate treatment effects earlier and potentially detect those tumours that have a tendency to grow. Nineteen patients with intracranial meningiomas were given irradiation with the 180-MeV proton beam at the Svedberg Laboratory, Uppsala, Sweden. The fractionation schedule used was in general a total dose of 24 Gy in four consecutive daily 6-Gy fractions. Serial 11C-Lmethionine PET examinations were used to evaluate the effect of stereotactic proton beam treatment. The radioactivity uptake in the tumour was evaluated as the ratio to the uptake in normal brain tissue. The follow-up period thus far is 36 months. In 15 of the 19 patients, 11C-L-methionine uptake was reduced 36 months after irradiation compared with the pre-treatment uptake of the tracer. In the total patient group the average reduction was 19.4%. Our results reveal that proton beam irradiation of meningiomas had an inhibitory effect on the methionine uptake in the meningiomas, although tumour size remained unchanged. The combination of unchanged tumour morphology and a reduction in methionine uptake after irradiation suggests that 11C-L-methionine PET might enable earlier evaluation of the treatment effect than is possible with CT or MRI

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Ten patients were planned with both 3D-CPT (two parallel-opposed lateral fields) and IMRT (seven equally spaced coplanar fields). Prescribed dose was 79.2 Gy (or cobalt Gray-equivalent, [CGE] for protons) to the prostate gland. Dose-volume histograms, dose conformity, and equivalent uniform dose (EUD) were compared. Additionally, plans were optimized for 3D-CPT with nonstandard beam configuration, and for IMPT assuming delivery with beam scanning. RESULTS: At least 98% of the planning target volume received the prescription dose. IMRT plans yielded better dose conformity to the target, whereas proton plans achieved higher dose homogeneity and better sparing of rectum and bladder in the range below 30 Gy/CGE. Bladder volumes receiving more than 70 Gy/CGE (V70) were reduced, on average, by 34% with IMRT vs. 3D-CPT, whereas rectal V70 were equivalent. EUD from 3D-CPT and IMRT plans were indistinguishable within uncertainties for both bladder and rectum. With the use of small-angle lateral-oblique fields in 3D-CPT and IMPT, the rectal V70 was reduced by up to 35% compared with the standard lateral configuration, whereas the bladder V70 increased by less than 10%. CONCLUSIONS: In the range higher than 60 Gy/CGE, IMRT achieved significantly better sparing of the bladder, whereas rectal sparing was similar with 3D-CPT and IMRT. Dose to healthy tissues in the range lower than 50% of the target prescription was substantially lower with proton therapy

[Japanese]	Aged, Carbon, Combined Modality Therapy, Female, Humans, Ions, Lung, Male, Middle Aged, Pancreatectomy, Pancreatic Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Pancreatic Neoplasms/th [Therapy], Prognosis, Prostate, Radiation, Radiotherapy,Adjuvant/mt [Methods], Recurrence	Prognosis of pancreatic cancer is still remarkably poor, even if complete resection was performed by enlarged abscission. On the other hand, carbon-ion beam therapy is giving good results in some selected carcinoma such as small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, uterus cancer, and soft tissue/bone tumor. In this report, we discuss four patients with pancreatic cancer treated by surgical pancreatectomy combined with preoperative carbon-ion beam irradiation. All patients were irradiated with 48 GyE carbon-iron beam by HIMAC (Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba) to the pancreatic area including lymph nodes and nerve plexus. Severe cholangitis, as the postoperative complication, had occurred in one of the patients. However, there was no complication or disorder caused by carbon-iron radiation. All four patients are alive now, but two of them developed tumor recurrence, one with hepatic metastasis and the other with peritoneal dissemination. Surgical treatment for pancreatic cancer combined with preoperative carbon-ion irradiation is expected as a promising cure, but it is necessary to examine more cases in the future to evaluate the clinical outcome of this treatment

[Chinese]	Adult, Aged, Carcinoma,Squamous Cell/pa [Pathology], Carcinoma,Squamous Cell/rt [Radiotherapy], Cobalt Radioisotopes, Disease-Free Survival, Female, Humans, Incidence, Lymph Nodes/pa [Pathology], Male, Middle Aged, Multivariate Analysis, Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Neck/re [Radiation Effects], Neoplasm Staging, Particle Accelerators, Radioisotopes, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Recurrence, Survival Rate	BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients with negative cervical lymph node (N0-NPC) account for 20% -30% of all NPC patients. Prophylactic irradiation to the upper neck is a criterion of treatment for these patients. But some authors suggest to prophylactically irradiate the the whole neck. This study was to analyze and compare long-term outcomes of the N0-NPC patients treated by prophylactic irradiation to the upper neck and to the whole neck, and explore radiotherapy on neck for N0-NPC patients. METHODS: A total of 178 N0-NPC patients, proved by pathology, were treated in our hospital from Jul. 1998 to Dec. 1999. Of the 178 patients, 88 received prophylactic irradiation to the upper neck (upper neck group), 90 received prophylactic irradiation to the whole neck (whole neck group). Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were used to analyze and compare survival rate of the 2 groups. Cox model was used to study prognostic factors of N0-NPC. RESULTS: The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were 98.9%, 90.9%, and 80.7% in upper neck group, and 97.8%, 80.0%, and 71.1% in whole neck group (P = 0.224). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year disease-free survival rates were 93.2%, 80.7%, and 77.3% in upper neck group, and 85.6%, 68.9%, and 64.4% in whole neck group (P = 0.163). The incidence of cervical lymph nodes recurrence was 1.14% in upper neck group, and 1.09% in whole neck group (P> 0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that gender, T stage, and short-term outcome were independent prognostic factors of N0-NPC. CONCLUSION: Prophylactic irradiation to upper neck is recommended for N0-NPC patients	
0	1849	Potential role of intensity modulated proton beams in prostate cancer radiotherapy	Femur Head, Head, Humans, Male, Probability, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Rectum, Risk, Switzerland, Time, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Universities, Urinary Bladder, X-Rays	PURPOSE: The present study was undertaken to assess the potential benefit of intensity modulated (IM) proton beams in optimizing the dose distribution to safely escalate the tumor dose in prostate cancer radiotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Four treatment plans were compared in a prostate cancer patient aiming to deliver 81 Gy to the target: 1) conformal 18 MV X-rays, 6-fields; 2) 214 MeV protons, 2-fields; 3) IM 15 MV X-rays, 5-fields; and 4) 177-200 Mev IM protons, 5-fields as in Plan 3. In addition, IM methods were used to further escalate the tumor dose to 99 Gy. Dose-volume histograms (DVH) were used to physically compare the treatment plans. DVH data were also used to obtain normal tissue complication probabilities (NTCP) for the rectum, bladder, femoral heads, and tumor control probabilities. RESULTS: Although the planning target volume dose distribution was satisfactory with the four treatment plans, the homogeneity was slightly reduced in both X-ray plans (IM and standard) and the low-to-medium doses delivered to all organs at risk, and other normal tissues were significantly reduced by both proton plans. For a prescribed dose of 81 Gy, only the IM X-ray and IM proton plans both succeeded in predicting an acceptably low NTCP for the rectum (<5%, Grade 3). The integral nontarget dose was significantly reduced with IM proton beams (i.e., 3.1, 1.3, and 1.7 times less than Plans 1, 2, and 3, respectively). When escalating the dose to 99 Gy, no additional improvement between IM protons and IM X-ray beams was observed. CONCLUSION: Both IM X-ray and proton beams were able to optimize the dose distribution and comply with the goal of delivering the highest dose to the target while reducing the risk of severe morbidity to acceptable levels. The main advantage compared to IM X-rays was that IM protons succeeded in significantly reducing the low-to-medium dose to the nontarget tissues and achieved a small improvement in planning target volume (PTV) dose heterogeneity

Consequences of treatment are likely to affect the survivor's quality of life significantly. We investigated the feasibility of spot-scanning proton therapy (PT) for soft tissue tumors in childhood. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Sixteen children with soft tissue sarcomas were included. Median age at PT was 3.3 years. In 10 children the tumor histology was embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma. All tumors were located in the head or neck, parameningeal, or paraspinal, or pelvic region. In the majority of children, the tumor was initially unresectable (Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study [IRS] Group III in 75%). In 50% of children the tumors exceeded 5 cm. Fourteen children had chemotherapy before and during PT. Median total dose of radiotherapy was 50 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE). All 16 children were treated with spot-scanning proton therapy at the Paul Scherrer Institute, and in 3 children the PT was intensity-modulated (IMPT). RESULTS: After median follow-up of 1.5 years, local control was achieved in 12 children. Four children failed locally, 1 at the border of the radiation field and 3 within the field. All 4 children died of tumor recurrence. All 4 showed unfavorable characteristic either of site or histopathology of the tumor. Acute toxicity was low, with Grade 3 or 4 side effects according to Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (RTOG/EORTC) criteria occurring in the bone marrow only. CONCLUSIONS: Proton therapy was feasible and well tolerated. Early local control rates are comparable to those being achieved after conventional radiotherapy. For investigations on late effect, longer follow-up is needed	
0	579	Outcomes of surgery for resection of regions of symptomatic radiation injury after stereotactic radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformations	Adult, California, Female, Helium, Humans, Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/ra [Radiography], Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/su [Surgery], Male, Middle Aged, Necrosis, Radiation, Radiation Injuries, Radiation Injuries/ra [Radiography], Radiation Injuries/su [Surgery], Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/ae [Adverse Effects], Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Research, Retrospective Studies, Time, Treatment Outcome	OBJECTIVE: Although radiation injury after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), including radiation necrosis (RN), is often treated with surgical resection, detailed outcome data are lacking after resection of symptomatic radiation-injured regions with imaging characteristics suspicious for RN after SRS for arteriovenous malformations (AVM). We present outcomes in seven such patients. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of seven patients with AVMs of Spetzler-Martin Grades II (n = 1), III (n = 2), and IV (n = 4) who underwent helium ion, proton beam, or gamma knife SRS and required resection of RN-suspicious tissue 1 to 24 months after post-SRS symptom onset. Postoperative outcomes included Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) score and time to symptomatic improvement. RESULTS: Symptomatic improvement required at least 9 months in the three patients with large regions suspicious for RN (>or=4 cm), whereas of four patients with smaller regions (<4 cm), three showed improvement within 2 months (P < 0.05). The remaining patient, who showed no benefit, underwent resection 2 years after the onset of RN symptoms (compared with <or= 8 mo for the other six patients). Surgery improved KPS scores in four patients with a preoperative KPS score of 50 or lower, but not in three patients with preoperative KPS scores greater than 70 (P < 0.05). Outcomes were not consistently associated with AVM size or location, SRS treatment volume or dose, associated aneurysm, or residual AVM. CONCLUSION: After SRS for AVMs, resection of symptomatic RN-suspicious tissue areas is beneficial in reversing neurological deficits and improving KPS scores in selected patients. Times to improvement were longer when larger areas were resected. Delaying such surgery after symptom onset may negatively affect improvement	
0	1222	Preoperative carbon ion radiotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer with chest wall invasion--pathological findings concerning tumor response and radiation induced lung injury in the resected organs	Aged, Carbon, Carbon/tu [Therapeutic Use], Carcinoma,Non-Small-Cell Lung/pa [Pathology], Carcinoma,Non-Small-Cell Lung/ra [Radiography], Carcinoma,Non-Small-Cell Lung/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Fibrosis, Humans, Ions, Japan, Lung, Lung Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Lung Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Lung Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Lung/re [Radiation Effects], Lymph Node Excision, Male, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Invasiveness, Neoplasm Staging, Pulmonary Fibrosis/et [Etiology], Pulmonary Fibrosis/pa [Pathology], Radiation, Radiation Injuries/pa [Pathology], Radiotherapy, Research, Safety, Thoracic Surgical Procedures	The purpose of this study was to make a pathological evaluation of the tumor response and the lung injury of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients after carbon ion therapy. We enrolled four NSCLC patients with chest wall invasion but without nodal and distant metastasis (T3N0M0). Only primary lesions were irradiated with carbon ions, followed by surgical resection. The patients consisted of three males and one female varying by age from 54 to 73 (average 66.3). Total treatment dose was 59.4 and 64.8 GyE, respectively, administered in 18 fractions over 6 weeks, or 72.0 GyE in 16 fractions over 4 weeks. Resection after radiation therapy was performed as a combination of lobectomy, lymph node dissection and chest wall surgery. After fixation, the lung was sliced into thin sections to match the CT image. Each slice was anatomically identified and the slices were compared with each other subjected to pathological analysis. No tumor cells were observed in two cases. The other two cases exhibited only a few tumor cells sparsely distributed in the lung tissue. There was evidence of dense pulmonary fibrosis in the limited space surrounding primary tumors, but its density was found to rapidly decrease in the narrow area toward the outside. The rate at which its density subsided mirrored the rapid decrease in the planning CT dose distribution. Microscopy showed no evidence of fibrosis in any of the fields irradiated with less than 15 GyE. Microscopy confirmed an outstanding tumor response with limited pulmonary fibrosis. This substantiates the superior dose localization and strong biological effect of carbon ion beams with a Bragg peak in the lung. The pathological findings have thus provided evidence of the safety and effectiveness of carbon beam therapy in the treatment of NSCLC

Perforated intestines as a late morbidity after carbon ion radiotherapy for uterine cancers were examined to reveal the biological characteristics of carbon ion for future applications for the treatment of gastrointestinal cancers. METHODS: Between June 1995 and December 2004, 94 patients with carcinoma of the uterine cervix or corpus were treated with carbon ion therapy. Among them, 9 patients (9.6%) developed major late gastrointestinal (GI) complications. Four out of 9 patients had intestinal perforations excised operatively at our institute. The postoperative clinical courses and histopathological findings of the excised intestine were investigated. RESULTS: Carbon ion irradiation severely damaged smooth muscle layers by coagulation necrosis as well as atrophy of the intestinal epithelium and middle-sized arterial thromboses of the intestines. After evaluating late complications, the dose constraints on the GI tracts were set under 60 GyE to prevent major complications. Thereafter, the incidence of major GI complications markedly decreased. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrated the characteristic histopathological effects of carbon ion radiotherapy and thus are expected to facilitate future additional applications of carbon ion radiotherapy for the treatment of gastrointestinal cancers

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between September 1998 and April 2002, 16 patients with histopathologically proven ACC and residual macroscopic tumor were treated with combined photon RT and a carbon ion boost to the macroscopic tumor. Median total tumor dose within the gross tumor volume (GTV) was 72 GyE. Photon radiation therapy (RT) consisted of fractionated stereotactic RT in 7 patients; 9 patients received stereotactic intensity-modulated RT. Carbon ion boost was delivered by intensity-controlled raster scanning at the heavy ion synchrotron (SIS) at the Heavy Ion Research Center (GSI) in Darmstadt. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 12 months. Three patients developed locoregional recurrences 9, 11, and 24 months after RT, respectively. Actuarial local control rates were 80.8% and 64.6% at 1 and 3 years, respectively. Overall survival rates were 100% and 83.3% at 1 and 3 years, respectively. Acute side effects greater than Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) Grade 2 were observed in 2 patients; no patient developed late effects > CTC Grade 2. CONCLUSIONS: Combined photon and carbon ion RT is feasible and effective in patients with locally advanced ACC. Acute and late toxicity is moderate with respect to the delivered tumor doses and in accordance with the radiobiologic modeling. A Phase III trial is designed

All patients underwent standardized A and B scan ultrasonography, fluorescein and indocyanine green videoangiography (FV, ICGV) before and after treatment with proton beam irradiation. The follow-up was carried out at 1, 3, 5, 8 months and then every 6 months. The mean follow-up was 26 months (range 6-46 months). The thickness of the tumors was demonstrated to be decreased and the internal reflectivity to be enhanced in 12 out of 14 cases from 8 months after treatment till the end of the follow-up period. In 2 eyes which were enucleated 5 months after treatment, histopathology confirmed that medium-low internal reflectivity corresponded to several areas of high cellularity and cellular mitosis. FV and ICGV were impossible because of opacities of dioptric media in 2 cases. From 8 months after treatment till the end of the follow-up period, in all the examined patients, FV demonstrated large hypofluorescent zones of the lesions which represented the destruction of the vascular tree of the tumor. From 8 months after treatment till the end of the follow-up period, ICGV demonstrated hypofluorescence of the lesions in 8 cases; mild hyperfluorescence and zones of colorant staining were present in late angiograms in 2 cases. The results of our study seem to confirm the reliability of standardized A and B scan ultrasonography in the follow-up of PCMM treated with proton beam irradiation; if ultrasonography is used together with FV and ICGV, the reliability of this combination is surely higher

Most uveal melanomas were large, with a mean tumor thickness of 6.5 mm; approximately 60% of the patients had tumors that extended anterior to the equator. A complete follow-up was obtained for all patients. One hundred twelve patients were alive at the time of this report; 18% of the patients developed clinical and laboratory evidence of metastases and eventually died of widespread tumor. Eighty-four percent of eyes were retained. Data were analyzed with a number of parametric and nonparametric techniques. Larger tumors and those located in close proximity to the optic nerve and fovea had a higher incidence of most complications, especially visual loss

Oncologically the combination of external radiotherapy and brachytherapy offers an alternative treatment option. The functional results and the complication rate in stage III and IV tumors of the oral tongue, floor of mouth and oropharynx are described in a patients series. METHOD: The follow-up includes 17 consecutive patients who were primarily treated by a combination of external radiotherapy and brachytherapy between 1997 and 2000. The oncological benefit (complete remission, disease-free survival), the functional results (mastication, swallowing, speech and pain) and the complications were reviewed. RESULTS: After the follow-up period 16/17 patients were alive. There were 3 major complications, one of them lethal. The functional results resembled those after surgical resections. CONCLUSIONS: A combined radiotherapy is a feasible method of treating patients who refrain from surgery. Moreover the application ranges from inoperability to postoperative radiotherapy in cases with close or positive margins. In connection with neck-dissections and therapy of recurrent cancer major complications may occur. In contrast to the general opinion radiation therapy was not superior to surgical resection concerning functional sequelae

In all patients N-acetyl-aspartate signals were decreased in tumour areas compared to the normal brain hemisphere. No recovery was seen after radiotherapy. Choline signals were increased in tumour margins of high grade gliomas and more diffusely in low grade gliomas. In 5 patients the choline resonance decreased after radiotherapy, accompanied by a shrinkage of tumour diameter on MRI. Lactate signals were present in high grade and unspecified astrocytomas and absent in most low grade gliomas. In 3 patients the lactate signal disappeared after radiotherapy. These observations indicate the feasibility of 1H-MRS in monitoring metabolic responses on radiotherapy of brain gliomas

Eligible patients were those receiving 3000 rad or more to the mediastinum and no chemotherapy prior to the radiation. During the study period, 13 patients developed symptomatic pericarditis. The interval post treatment to the development of symptoms was six to 34 months. The incidence of pericarditis was studied as a function of: (1) the dose of radiation at a depth of 2 cm, 5 cm and the midplane of the mediastinum; (2) the ratio of anterior to posterior weighting of dose; (3) the presence or absence of intrathoracic tumor; (4) the size of the tumor when present; and (5) the fraction of the heart exposed to the radiation beam. There was a significant increase in the incidence of pericarditis with an increased dose of radiation at 2 cm, 5 cm and midplane depths and also with the presence of a large intrathoracic tumor. A reduction in mediastinal dose is recommended

This study was designed to evaluate the QOL of disease-freely survival NPC patients after treatment, and to investigate the factors correlated with their QOL. METHODS: From Jul. to Aug. 2003, disease-freely survival NPC patients who had been treated from 1999 to 2000 in Cancer Center of Sun Yat-sen University were enrolled. The Chinese SF-36 questionnaire and a checklist consists of 14 items about self-rating symptoms were self-reported by all participants at clinic. Sociodemographic and clinical data of the patients were also collected, and their relationships with SF-36 data and symptoms were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 192 patients were enrolled in the study. The median survival time was 3.6 years (ranged 2.4-4.6 years). Xerostomia was the first common symptom, followed by hypoacusis, hypomnesia, dysphagia, and trismus. Univariate analysis showed that gender, age, educational level, monthly income, economic status, religion, and the number of complications had influences on QOL; the patients in earlier T and N stages, irradiated by linear accelerator, with lower total dose and weekly dosage to the nasopharynx and neck, and those who had anterior nasal field radiation reported better QOL. Multiple stepwise regression analysis showed that the number of complications, monthly income, age, and T stage were independent factors affecting total QOL. CONCLUSIONS: Improving radiotherapy might enhance physical functions of NPC patients. The prevention and control of chronic diseases, the development of economy, and the increase of income may promote NPC patients' QOL

This study was undertaken to determine the feasibility of dose escalation using proton therapy, as compared to conventional 3-dimensional conformal radiation, by minimizing the dose to normal tissues. The photon treatment plans of 4 patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer treated on a biologic therapy trial were utilized. Each patient was treated using a 3- or 4-field photon plan with 45 Gy to the clinical target volume (CTV), followed by a boost of 14.4 Gy to the gross target volume (GTV). Using a Helax treatment planning system, proton plans were generated to encompass the same CTV and GTV to the same prescribed dose. Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) were generated for the GTV, CTV, spinal cord, liver, and right and left kidneys. Each DVH was compared between the photon and proton plans. Proton plans utilized either a 2- or 3-field technique. Available energies included 130 or 180 MeV. Range modulators and bolus were used as needed to conform to the target volume. With the CTV and GTV receiving the same dose from the proton and photon plans, all individual proton plans were superior to the photon plans in reduction of normal tissue dose. For the 4 patients, the average dose reduction to 50% of the organ at risk was 78% to spinal cord (p = 0.003), 73% to left kidney (p = 0.025), 43% to right kidney (p = 0.059), and 55% to liver (p = 0.061). These comparative treatment plans show proton therapy results in significant reductions of dose to normal tissue compared to conventional photons while treating the same target volumes. This allows for the design of dose-escalation protocols using protons in combination with new biologic therapies and chemotherapy

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A survey was performed between the Hungarian radiotherapy centers in order to compare the dose prescription methods. Then, treatment plans of 125 breast cancer patients treated in our department were evaluated. The irradiations were performed with cobalt unit, and with 6 and 9 MV photon beams of linear accelerators. The dose distributions were normalized to izocenter, then dose values in five points in central plane; local medial, lateral and central maximums (D(med), D(lat) and D(cent)); volumetric maximum and its location were determined. To characterize the dose to lung and to heart at left-sided tumors the central lung distance (CLD) and maximum heart distance (MHD) were used. Based on the results, estimation was made to assess the differences between delivered dose due to various dose prescriptions applied at the institutions. RESULTS: Four types of dose prescription are currently used in our country, and most frequently the isocenter is selected as a reference point. In the central plane the calculated dose in all but one points differed only a little from the dose to isocenter. The mean D(med), D(lat) and D(cent) were 107%, 107% and 101%, respectively. The volumetric maximum was on average 13% higher than the dose to isocenter. Regarding the beam qualities, this value was 16%, 13% and 11% for cobalt unit, 6 MV and 9 MV photon beams, respectively. The mean CLD and MHD were 1.9 and 0.8 cm, respectively. The difference between delivered doses at the institutions was 6% on average, but in extreme cases it can be as high as 20%. CONCLUSIONS: Three-dimensional treatment planning and plan evaluation are recommended at breast irradiation, especially for large breasts. Since the various dose prescriptions may result in significant differences in the delivered doses, use of a standard dose prescription protocol is recommended	
1	1806	CT evaluation of hepatic injury following proton beam irradiation: appearance, enhancement, and 3D size reduction pattern	Adult, Aged, Carcinoma,Hepatocellular/co [Complications], Carcinoma,Hepatocellular/ra [Radiography], Carcinoma,Hepatocellular/rt [Radiotherapy], Chi-Square Distribution, Child, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Japan, Liver Neoplasms/co [Complications], Liver Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Liver Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Liver/ra [Radiography], Liver/re [Radiation Effects], Male, Middle Aged, Protons, Protons/ae [Adverse Effects], Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Injuries/et [Etiology], Radiation Injuries/ra [Radiography], Radiotherapy Dosage, Remission,Spontaneous, Sex Characteristics, Time, Time Factors, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Tomography,X-Ray Computed/is [Instrumentation], Tomography,X-Ray Computed/mt [Methods], Tomography,X-Ray Computed/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Universities	PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the long-term imaging appearances of hepatic injury following proton beam irradiation. The time-attenuation curves, time of appearance and recovery, and 3D size reduction pattern are described in patients of different ages and genders with different irradiation doses, irradiated portals, and Child groups. METHOD: Forty-six patients with hepatocellular carcinoma underwent 50 to 84 Gy proton beam irradiation in periods of 14-52 days. CT including noncontrast and dynamic study was performed every 3 months starting 3 weeks after the end of irradiation. The 3D volume measurement of areas of radiation-induced hepatic injury was performed through incremental dynamic CT images in every follow-up study. CT follow-up study of the patients was done for 12-76 months. RESULTS: Radiation-induced hepatic injury was observed as low attenuation areas on noncontrast CT and enhanced areas on dynamic study in the regions corresponding to the irradiation portals. Of our cases, 67.5% showed the appearance of radiation hepatitis in 3-4 weeks and 95.3% in 3-4 months after the end of irradiation. In both periods, there was a significant delay in the female patients. The time-attenuation curve showed an early and prolonged enhancement of the irradiated regions. The volume reduction pattern of the injured areas was found to be longstanding, exponential, and directed from periphery to the center. CONCLUSION: Early appearance of radiation-induced hepatic injury was found only to be gender dependent, with a tendency to occur with higher irradiated doses; no other parameters affected this phenomenon in our cases. Disappearance of the injured areas, if present, takes a long time (at least 42 months)

[Japanese]	Aged, Aged,80 and over, Cancer Care Facilities, Carbon, Female, Head, Humans, Japan, Liver, Lung, Male, Middle Aged, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Prostate, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation], Safety, Treatment Outcome	The Hyogo Ion Beam Medical Center(HIBMC) is a hospital-based charged particle treatment facility. Having two treatment ion beams(proton and carbon) and five treatment rooms, it is a pioneer among particle institutes worldwide. In May 2001, proton therapy was started as a clinical study for patients with localized cancer originating in the head and neck, lung, liver, and prostate. The aim of this study was to investigate the safety, effectiveness, and stability of the treatment units and systems based on the evaluation of acute toxicity, tumor response, and working ratio of the machine, respectively. Six patients, including liver cancer in three, prostate cancer in two, and lung cancer in one, were treated. There was no cessation of therapy owing to machine malfunction. Full courses of proton therapy consisting of 154 portals in all six patients were given exactly as scheduled. None of the patients experienced severe acute reactions of more than grade 3 according to NCI-CTC criteria. Tumor response one month post-treatment was evaluable in five of the six patients, and was CR in 1 (prostate cancer), PR in 2 (lung cancer: 1, liver cancer: 1), and NC in 2(liver cancer: 2). These results indicate that our treatment units and systems are safe and reliable enough for proton irradiation to be used for several malignant tumors localized in the body

Since November 1987, 26 patients with resectable gastric cancer were irradiated intraoperatively with the linear accelerator using fast electrons (single dose: 12 to 16 Gy). Percutaneous radiotherapy was performed postoperatively with 24 to 38 Gy (4 x 2 Gy per week). For intraoperative and percutaneous radiotherapy the target absorbed dose was selected in a way that their combined effect on the tumor was approximately equivalent to that of a total dose of 60 Gy in the usual fractionating. Up to now, the median survival time for stage III patients (UICC 1987) has been twelve months. In five patients who died of a relapse or of peritoneal carcinosis, histologic evaluation revealed in every case a diffuse tumor type according to Lauren-classification. All relapses occurred within the first eight months. The two-year survival rate according to Kaplan-Meier is 67% for stage III. Advanced resectable gastric cancer of the intestinal tumor type seems to profit from adjuvant intraoperative radiotherapy. The results warrant further research within the framework of a prospective randomized multicenter study	
0	579	Outcomes of surgery for resection of regions of symptomatic radiation injury after stereotactic radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformations	Adult, California, Female, Helium, Humans, Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/ra [Radiography], Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/su [Surgery], Male, Middle Aged, Necrosis, Radiation, Radiation Injuries, Radiation Injuries/ra [Radiography], Radiation Injuries/su [Surgery], Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/ae [Adverse Effects], Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Research, Retrospective Studies, Time, Treatment Outcome	OBJECTIVE: Although radiation injury after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), including radiation necrosis (RN), is often treated with surgical resection, detailed outcome data are lacking after resection of symptomatic radiation-injured regions with imaging characteristics suspicious for RN after SRS for arteriovenous malformations (AVM). We present outcomes in seven such patients. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of seven patients with AVMs of Spetzler-Martin Grades II (n = 1), III (n = 2), and IV (n = 4) who underwent helium ion, proton beam, or gamma knife SRS and required resection of RN-suspicious tissue 1 to 24 months after post-SRS symptom onset. Postoperative outcomes included Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) score and time to symptomatic improvement. RESULTS: Symptomatic improvement required at least 9 months in the three patients with large regions suspicious for RN (>or=4 cm), whereas of four patients with smaller regions (<4 cm), three showed improvement within 2 months (P < 0.05). The remaining patient, who showed no benefit, underwent resection 2 years after the onset of RN symptoms (compared with <or= 8 mo for the other six patients). Surgery improved KPS scores in four patients with a preoperative KPS score of 50 or lower, but not in three patients with preoperative KPS scores greater than 70 (P < 0.05). Outcomes were not consistently associated with AVM size or location, SRS treatment volume or dose, associated aneurysm, or residual AVM. CONCLUSION: After SRS for AVMs, resection of symptomatic RN-suspicious tissue areas is beneficial in reversing neurological deficits and improving KPS scores in selected patients. Times to improvement were longer when larger areas were resected. Delaying such surgery after symptom onset may negatively affect improvement

Consequences of treatment are likely to affect the survivor's quality of life significantly. We investigated the feasibility of spot-scanning proton therapy (PT) for soft tissue tumors in childhood. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Sixteen children with soft tissue sarcomas were included. Median age at PT was 3.3 years. In 10 children the tumor histology was embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma. All tumors were located in the head or neck, parameningeal, or paraspinal, or pelvic region. In the majority of children, the tumor was initially unresectable (Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study [IRS] Group III in 75%). In 50% of children the tumors exceeded 5 cm. Fourteen children had chemotherapy before and during PT. Median total dose of radiotherapy was 50 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE). All 16 children were treated with spot-scanning proton therapy at the Paul Scherrer Institute, and in 3 children the PT was intensity-modulated (IMPT). RESULTS: After median follow-up of 1.5 years, local control was achieved in 12 children. Four children failed locally, 1 at the border of the radiation field and 3 within the field. All 4 children died of tumor recurrence. All 4 showed unfavorable characteristic either of site or histopathology of the tumor. Acute toxicity was low, with Grade 3 or 4 side effects according to Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (RTOG/EORTC) criteria occurring in the bone marrow only. CONCLUSIONS: Proton therapy was feasible and well tolerated. Early local control rates are comparable to those being achieved after conventional radiotherapy. For investigations on late effect, longer follow-up is needed	
0	1627	Effects of proton and combined proton/photon beam radiation on pulmonary function in patients with resectable but medically inoperable non-small cell lung cancer	Aged, Aged,80 and over, Carbon, Carcinoma,Non-Small-Cell Lung/pa [Pathology], Carcinoma,Non-Small-Cell Lung/rt [Radiotherapy], Carcinoma,Non-Small-Cell Lung/su [Surgery], Cobalt, Combined Modality Therapy, Diffusion, Dose Fractionation, Female, Germany, Humans, Lung, Lung Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Lung Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Lung Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Male, Middle Aged, Neoadjuvant Therapy, Neoplasm Staging, Photons, Protons, Radiation, Respiratory Function Tests, Universities	STUDY OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the effects on pulmonary function of irradiating lung cancer with protons alone or protons combined with photons. DESIGN: Prospective phase I/II study. SETTING: University medical center. PATIENTS AND INTERVENTIONS: Ten patients with stage I-II non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and FEV(1) < or = 1.0 L were irradiated with protons to areas of gross disease only, using 51 cobalt gray equivalents (CGE) in 10 fractions (protocol 1). Fifteen patients with stage I-IIIA NSCLC and FEV(1) > 1.0 L received 45-Gy photon irradiation to the primary lung tumor and the mediastinum, plus a 28.8-CGE proton boost to the gross tumor volume (protocol 2). MEASUREMENTS: Pulmonary function was evaluated prior to treatment and 1 month, 3 months, and 6 to 12 months following irradiation. RESULTS: In patients receiving protocol 1, no significant changes in pulmonary function occurred. In patients receiving protocol 2, at 6 to 12 months, the diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide had declined from 61% of predicted to 45% of predicted (p < 0.05), total lung capacity had declined from 114% of predicted to 95% of predicted (p < 0.05), and residual volume had declined from 160% of predicted to 132% of predicted (p < 0.05). Airway resistance increased from 3.8 to 5.2 cm H(2)O/L/s (p < 0.05). No statistically significant changes occurred in vital capacity, FEV(1), or PaO(2). CONCLUSIONS: Our observations indicate that it is feasible to apply higher-than-conventional doses of radiation at a higher-than-conventional dose per fraction without excess pulmonary toxicity when conformal radiation techniques with protons are used

Twenty tumors (1.9%) exhibited definitive growth between 4 months and 66 months after irradiation (median, 19 months): 10 were marginal recurrences, 5 were ring melanomas, 3 were uncontrolled tumors, and 2 were extrascleral extensions. Ten of these eyes were enucleated without further intervention, 2 patients died of metastases soon after the growth was detected, and 8 patients had further conservative therapy. In 5 other patients, tumor growth was suspected but unconfirmed and the eye was enucleated elsewhere; the 5-year probability of local tumor control based on 25 recurrences was 97% +/- 1%. There was a nonsignificant increase in the rate of metastases among patients with documented tumor recurrence (adjusted relative risk, 1.5; 95% confidence interval, 0.66 to 3.4). Results suggest that recurrence of uveal melanomas treated by proton beam therapy is uncommon, but that treatment failure may increase risk of death from metastasis

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Dose plans of 6 stereotactically treated patients were recalculated for IMSRT by use of the same field setup and an inverse planning algorithm. Proton and IMPT plans were calculated anew. Three different tumor shapes, multifocal, ovoid, and irregular, were analyzed, as well as dose to organs-at-risk (OAR) in the vicinity of the planning target volume (PTV). Dose distributions were calculated from beam-setup data for a manual mMLC for stereotactically guided conformal radiotherapy (SCRT), a dynamic mMLC for IMSRT, the spot-scanning technique for protons, and a modified spot-scanning technique for IMPT. SCRT was included for a part of the comparison. Criteria for assessment were PTV coverage, dose-volume histograms (DVH), volumes of specific isodoses, and the dose to OAR. RESULTS: Dose conformation to the PTV is equally good for all three techniques and tumor shapes considered. The volumes of the 90% and 80% isodose were comparable for all techniques. For the 50% isodose volume, a divergence between the two modes was seen. In 3 cases, this volume is smaller for IMSRT, and in the 3 other cases, it is smaller for IMPT. This difference was even more pronounced for the volumes of the 30% isodose; IMPT shows further improvement over conventional protons. OAR in concavities (e.g., the brainstem) were similarly well spared by protons and IMSRT. IMPT spares critical organs best. Fewer proton beams are required to achieve similar results. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of intensity modulation improves the conformality of mMLC-based SCRT. Conformation of dose to the PTV is comparable for IMSRT, protons, and IMPT. Concerning the sparing of OAR, IMSRT is equivalent to IMPT, and IMPT is superior to conventional protons. The advantage of protons lies in the lower integral dose

Lung injury due to irradiation was evaluated by measuring routing parameters of pulmonary function. No statistically significant changes in these parameters were observed after irradiation, even in patients followed up for a period of 1 year. Chest X-ray examinations, including CT scan images, disclosed the development of nonsegmental consolidations in the irradiated areas, changing into minor fibrosis 1 year later. We concluded that heavy ion particle irradiation has minimal impact on pulmonary function, and is of therapeutic valve to elderly patients and patients with complications

[French]	France, Head, Humans, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Prostate, Quality Control, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage/st [Standards], Radiotherapy/st [Standards], Time	Since January 2001, radiotherapy treatments with modulated intensity beams (IMRT) have started at the Centre Oscar-Lambret. This paper presents the tests and measurements made before the clinical implementation as well the quality control performed before each routine treatment. We use the treatment planning system Helax-TMS (MDS-Nordion) and the Primus accelerator (Siemens) linked to the Lantis network with Primeview and Simtec modules (Siemens) allowing to deliver intensity modulated beams with Step-and-Shoot technique. A prostate case and a head and neck case have been studied and have permitted to evaluate the benefit of IMRT compared to a "classical" conformal radiotherapy. In a second time, we have tested the accelerator's capabilities to deliver these intensity modulated beams, id-est, the accuracy of the leaf positions and the linearity of the monitor chamber. The third step has been the verification of the dose distributions calculated by Helax-TMS, id-est, the dose for different segment sizes, the dose profiles for an intensity modulated beam and the dose distribution for all the traitment beams. The used phantom has been especially developed at the Centre Oscar-Lambret for IMRT. The results have allowed to start clinical treatments and to establish a quality control set for this technique. The next step is the real time dosimetry with a portal imager

The rate of recurrence is particularly high in cases of large size tumor, of widespread tumors and with PAM associated lesions. Tumor recurrences have a bad long-term prognostic significance and often necessitate exenteration. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A method of therapy combining total surgical excision with proton-beam irradiation, cobalt plaque irradiation and cryotherapy is described. This technique is used in particular unfavorable cases with the aim of lowering the rate of recurrences. It was practiced in 19 cases in Lausanne, 10 of which were recurrent tumors. The melanoma invaded 3 quadrants of the bulbar conjunctiva in 8 cases and 4 quadrants in 11 cases. At least one neighbouring tarsal conjunctiva was invaded in 11 cases and both in 7 cases. The skin of the eyelid was infiltrated in 6 cases and the caruncle in 9 cases. Tumor thickness was 1 to 2 mm in 8 cases, 3 to 4 mm in 4 cases and 5 to 10 mm in 7 cases. RESULTS: PAM was present in 16 cases. Follow-up period was less than 1 year in 2 cases, between 1 to 2 years in 5 cases, between 2 to 3 years in 5 cases and more than 3 years in 7 cases. 5 patients had lymph node metastases, 3 died of metastatic disease and 2 had a local recurrence. One of these recurrences was small-sized and was excised, the other was widespread and the patient died soon with metastatic disease. No exenteration was performed. CONCLUSION: The method of therapy that is here described appears to be a valuable alternative to exenteration of the orbit for the treatment of diffuse or large-size conjunctival melanomas which have a high risk of local recurrence

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirteen patients with skull base chordoma who were treated with proton beams with or without X-rays at the University of Tsukuba between 1989 and 2000 were retrospectively reviewed. A median total tumor dose of 72.0 Gy (range, 63.0-95.0 Gy) was delivered. The patients were followed for a median period of 69.3 months (range, 14.6-123.4 months). RESULTS: The 5-year local control rate was 46.0%. Cause-specific, overall, and disease-free survival rates at 5 years were 72.2%, 66.7%, and 42.2%, respectively. The local control rate was higher, without statistical significance, for those with preoperative tumors <30 mL. Partial or subtotal tumor removal did not yield better local control rates than for patients who underwent biopsy only as the latest surgery. CONCLUSION: Proton beam therapy is effective for patients with skull base chordoma, especially for those with small tumors. For a patient with a tumor of <30 mL with no prior treatment, biopsy without tumor removal seems to be appropriate before proton beam therapy. [References: 38]

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Medical records of 53 patients treated to fields encompassing the cauda equina were reviewed for the onset of neurologic symptoms in the absence of local failure. All doses were normalized to equivalent dose delivered in 2-Gy fractions. Median cauda dose was 65.8 cobalt Gray equivalents (CGE) (range, 31.9-85.1). Median follow-up was 87 months (range, 14-217 months). RESULTS: Nineteen patients experienced local recurrences, and 13 others had neurologic toxicity. A total of 54% (i.e., 7/13) of the toxicities occurred 5 years or more after treatment. Median caudal dose was 73.7 CGE in the group with neurologic toxicity, and 55.6 CGE in those without. On multivariate actuarial analysis, cauda dose and gender were statistically significant for neurotoxicity at p = 0.002 and p = 0.017, respectively. The estimated tolerance doses 5 years from treatment, TD 5/5 and TD 50/5, were 55 CGE and 72 CGE, respectively, for males and 67 CGE and 84 CGE for females. The tolerance doses were about 8 CGE lower when estimated at 10 years from treatment. Disease-free survival rates at 5 and 10 years were 66% and 53%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the probability of neurotoxicity is a relatively steep function of dose to cauda equina (slope gamma50 = approximately 3). The cauda equina tolerance is greater for females than males by about 11 CGE (at 2 CGE per fraction). Extended follow-up is necessary to accurately assess neurologic damage and then differentiate that phenomenon from local recurrence; the traditional 5-year assessment has limited meaning in this population. Local control remains an issue for these patients, even with the radical doses used

It can be a very useful complement of traditional microsurgery, pharmacotherapy or fractionated radiotherapy which are seldom a sufficient treatment on their own. The modern radiosurgery does not offer the experience representative enough in this indication. We can offer results of medium long follow-up for tumor growth and hormonal hypersecretion of pituitary adenomas in a relatively large series of patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: We have analyzed a group of 163 patients with pituitary adenoma treated with gamma knife during 5 years and followed 12-60 months, median 24 months after irradiation. An antiproliferative effect has been achieved in 1-2 years using the minimal dose to the margin 16-35 Gy, median 20 Gy in all our patients who were controlled by MRI (n = 126 patients). One half of these adenomas evidently decreased their size. Our effective antiproliferative dose was safe for the surrounding structures. The hormonal normalization has been achieved at 50.4% from 133 hypersecreting adenomas (39/91 = 43% of acromegalics, 11/13 = 85% of patients with Cushing's disease, 2/9 = 22% of patients with Nelson's syndrome, 11/18 = 61% of prolactinomas). The median latency was 12 months. The minimal dose to the margin was 10-45 Gy, median 35 Gy. Rare side effects were provoked only by increasing the dose to influence the hypersecretion-the development of partial hypopituitarism in 3.1% of patients, the panhypopituitarism in 0.6% of patient and there was 1 hemianopic visual field defect (0.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Radiosurgery by gamma knife has a similar value for pituitary adenomas as microsurgery has with different distribution of advantages and drawbacks. This makes it suitable for the combined treatment where pharmacotherapy has its place under special conditions. Fractionated radiotherapy has now a marginal importance

In view of this, pilot studies were instituted at Massachusetts General Hospital in which 32 patients received the standard previous treatment of external beam irradiation and surgery but in addition had an intraoperative electron beam boost of 1000-1500 rad to the remaining tumor or tumor bed. For the 16 patients who presented with unresectable primary lesions, the addition of intraoperative radiotherapy has resulted in a total absence of local recurrence with a minimum 20 month follow-up, and survival rates are statistically better than for the previous group treated with only external beam irradiation and surgical resection. In the group with residual disease, again there have not been any local recurrences in the 7 patients who received all treatment modalities versus 54% and 26% for the group with gross and microscopic residual treated with only external beam techniques. The remaining 9 patients presented with recurrent unresectable lesions--3 are alive (2 NED) at greater than or equal to 3 years	
1	506	Risk factors of late rectal bleeding after carbon ion therapy for prostate cancer	Aged, Aged,80 and over, Carbon, Carbon Radioisotopes, Carbon Radioisotopes/ae [Adverse Effects], Comorbidity, Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage/mo [Mortality], Heavy Ions/ae [Adverse Effects], Humans, Incidence, Japan/ep [Epidemiology], Male, Middle Aged, Multivariate Analysis, Prevalence, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiation Injuries/ep [Epidemiology], Radioisotopes, Radiotherapy, Rectal Diseases/mo [Mortality], Research, Risk, Risk Assessment/mt [Methods], Risk Factors, Survival Analysis, Survival Rate	PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine the risk factors for late gastrointestinal (GI) morbidity after hypofractionated carbon ion radiotherapy (C-ion RT) for prostate cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between April 2000 and November 2003, a Phase II clinical trial of C-ion RT with a total dose of 66 GyE in 20 fractions was performed on 175 patients with prostate cancer, and the correlations of clinical and dosimetric parameters with the incidence of late GI toxicity in 172 patients who survived for more than 18 months were investigated. RESULTS: Although no Grade 3-4 late morbidities of the rectum were observed, Grade 1 and 2 morbidities developed in 23 (13%) and 4 (2%) patients, respectively. Dose-volume histogram analysis revealed that the percentage of rectal volume receiving 50% of the prescribed dose (V50) was significantly higher in patients with rectal toxicity than without toxicity (13.2 +/- 5.6% with toxicity; 11.4 +/- 4.0% without toxicity, p = 0.046). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the use of anticoagulation therapy (p = 0.010) and rectal V50 (p = 0.012) were significant risk factors for the occurrence of Grade 1-2 late GI toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Although C-ion RT with hypofractionation yielded favorable results regarding late GI complication, dosimetric parameter was a very important factor in the occurrence of rectal bleeding after C-ion RT as well as photon beam RT. Our results provide useful information for physicians applying charged particle RT in the treatment of prostate cancer	
0	4663	Proton therapy of uveal melanomas: intercomparison of MRI-based and conventional treatment planning	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Berlin, Eye, Female, Germany, Humans, Lead, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Methods, Middle Aged, Patients, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Risk, Safety, Tantalum, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Treatment Outcome, Universities, Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Proton therapy for uveal melanoma provides high-conformal dose application to the target volume and, thus, an optimal saving of the organs at risk nearby. Treatment planning is done with the model-based treatment-planning system EYEPLAN. Tumor reconstruction is based only on a fundus composite, which often leads to an overestimation of the clinical target volume (CTV). The purpose was to exploit MRI on trial in a proton therapy-planning system by using the novel image-based treatment-planning system OCTOPUS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten patients with uveal melanomas received both a high-resolution planning CT and MRI of the eye. MR examinations were made with an eye coil. EYEPLAN requires eye geometry data for modeling, and tantalum marker clips for submillimeter positioning and additional information from ultrasound and 3-D imaging. By contrast, OCTOPUS provides the full integration of 3-D imaging (e. g., CT, MRI). CTVs were delineated in each slice. For all patients, CTVs (EYEPLAN vs. OCTOPUS) were compared intraindividually. RESULTS: OCTOPUS planning led to a mean reduction of the target volume by a factor of 1.7 (T1-weighted [T1w]) and 2.2 (T2w) without compromising safety. The corresponding field size could be scaled down on average by a factor of 1.2 (T1w) and 1.4 (T2w), respectively. CONCLUSION: Compared with the conventional EYEPLAN, MRI-based treatment planning of ocular tumors with OCTOPUS could be a powerful tool for reducing the CTV and, consequently, the treatment volume and the field size. This might be translated into a better patient compliance during treatment and a decreased late toxicity

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 17-year-old male patient underwent corpus callosotomy conformal SRS using a dedicated linear accelerator (linac) with dynamic arcs technique. The prescribed dose was 36.0 Gy at the periphery of the rostrum, genu, and a half of the body of the corpus callosum (CCA). At 8 months after conformal SRS, the patient developed a significant brain edema and moderate transitory motor deficit, which were controlled with steroids. After 32 months follow-up, there is an improvement of 84% on drop attacks and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. CONCLUSIONS: Conformal SRS for corpus callosotomy with a single isocenter reproduce the results reported on literature using Gamma Knife-based SRS. The results show that this technique is safe and demonstrate its efficacy to control seizures	
1	2421	The 62 MeV proton beam for the treatment of ocular melanoma at Clatterbridge	Eye Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Radiation Dosage, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research, Scattering,Radiation, Water	A second treatment room and beam line has been constructed at the Cyclotron Unit at Clatterbridge for the purpose of using 62 MeV protons for the treatment of ocular melanoma. A uniform beam is produced by a double foil scattering system. The initial Bragg peak is spread across the target volume by the use of beam modulators. These are rotating four-vaned stepped absorbers made from Perspex. Two beam lines can be configured with different positions of modulators and range limiters. The first has a maximum penetration of 31.9 +/- 0.2 mm in water and the second a penetration of 31.2 +/- 0.2 mm. The second configuration has the advantage of less variation in beam penumbra, with a typical value of 1.7 +/- 0.1 mm for the 90% to 10% decrement lines. The patients are treated with individually shaped collimators. Beam output varies by less than 2% over the range of collimator areas used. The resulting whole-body dose equivalent to patient has also been assessed. In the first three years of operation over 250 patients have been treated

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Two children, one with a parameningeal rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) and a second with a medulloblastoma, were used as models for the purpose of this study. After defining the target and critical structures, treatment plans were calculated and optimized, four for the RMS case (conventional X-ray, IM X-rays, protons, and IM protons) and three for the irradiation of the spinal axis in medulloblastoma (conventional X-ray, IM X-rays, protons). Secondary cancer incidence was estimated using a model based on Publication No. 60 of the International Commission on Radiologic Protection. This model allowed estimation of absolute risks of secondary cancer for each treatment plan based on dose-volume distributions for the nontarget organs. RESULTS: Proton beams reduced the expected incidence of radiation-induced secondary cancers for the RMS patient by a factor of >or=2 and for the medulloblastoma case by a factor of 8 to 15 when compared with either IM or conventional X-ray plans. CONCLUSIONS: The potential for a significant reduction in secondary cancers with pediatric cancers after using proton beams (forward planned or IM) in the treatment of RMS and MBD in children and adolescents represents an additional argument supporting the development of proton therapy for most radiotherapy indications in pediatric oncology

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between September 1998 and April 2002, 16 patients with histopathologically proven ACC and residual macroscopic tumor were treated with combined photon RT and a carbon ion boost to the macroscopic tumor. Median total tumor dose within the gross tumor volume (GTV) was 72 GyE. Photon radiation therapy (RT) consisted of fractionated stereotactic RT in 7 patients; 9 patients received stereotactic intensity-modulated RT. Carbon ion boost was delivered by intensity-controlled raster scanning at the heavy ion synchrotron (SIS) at the Heavy Ion Research Center (GSI) in Darmstadt. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 12 months. Three patients developed locoregional recurrences 9, 11, and 24 months after RT, respectively. Actuarial local control rates were 80.8% and 64.6% at 1 and 3 years, respectively. Overall survival rates were 100% and 83.3% at 1 and 3 years, respectively. Acute side effects greater than Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) Grade 2 were observed in 2 patients; no patient developed late effects > CTC Grade 2. CONCLUSIONS: Combined photon and carbon ion RT is feasible and effective in patients with locally advanced ACC. Acute and late toxicity is moderate with respect to the delivered tumor doses and in accordance with the radiobiologic modeling. A Phase III trial is designed

There are several methods of managing them. Validity of these methods, however, is not sufficiently studied. We therefore investigated, whether moist skin care with 3% urea lotion will reduce acute radiation skin toxicity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 88 patients with carcinomas of the head and neck undergoing radiotherapy with curative intent (mean total dose 60 Gy, range: 50-74 Gy) were evaluated weekly for acute skin reactions according to the RTOG-CTC score. In 63 patients, moist skin care with 3% urea lotion was performed. The control group consisted of 25 patients receiving conventional dry skin care. The incidence of grade I, II, and III reactions and the radiation dose at occurrence of a particular reaction were determined and statistically analyzed using the log-rank test. The dose-time relations of individual skin reactions are described. RESULTS: At some point of time during radiotherapy, all patients suffered from acute skin reactions grade I, > 90% from grade II reactions. 50% of patients receiving moist skin care experienced grade I reactions at 26 Gy as compared to 22 Gy in control patients (p = 0.03). Grade II reactions occurred at 51 Gy versus 34 Gy (p = 0.006). Further, 22% of the patients treated with moist skin care suffered from acute skin toxicity grade III as compared to 56% of the controls (p = 0.0007). CONCLUSION: Moist skin care with 3% urea lotion delays the occurrence and reduces the grade of acute skin reactions in percutaneously irradiated patients with head and neck tumors	
1	411	Preferences of healthy inner city women and the surgical treatment of early stage breast cancer	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Breast, Breast Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Breast Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Mastectomy/mt [Methods], Middle Aged, Neoplasm Staging, Patient Education as Topic, Patient Satisfaction, Prospective Studies, Recurrence, Socioeconomic Factors, Treatment Outcome, Urban Population	Numerous studies have shown that women of a lower education level and socioeconomic status use less breast-conserving surgery than women of a higher education level and socioeconomic status. Surveys of healthy women and the surgical treatment of early stage breast cancer have been performed. However, no survey has focused exclusively on inner city women. The objective of this study was to determine the awareness, preferences, and concerns of inner-city, multiethnic women and the surgical treatment of stage I and II breast cancer, and to identify if a distinct treatment preference for mastectomy or lumpectomy exists in such a population. The study consisted of a prospective survey of volunteers, age 18 years and older, in the nononcologic clinics of St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx, New York. We consecutively surveyed 200 women between the ages of 18 and 75 using a 12-item form from January 2004 to May 2004. Of 200 surveys, 21 were excluded as incomplete and two women surveyed who gave a prior history of breast cancer were excluded from study, leaving 177 total surveys for analysis. Women were presented with a hypothetical diagnosis of early stage breast cancer curable by mastectomy or lumpectomy and radiation therapy. Women were asked about their surgery preferences, who they would seek advice from, if they would let their physician decide treatment, and their concerns if faced with a diagnosis of breast cancer. One hundred seventy-seven completed surveys were obtained; 124 (70%) women chose lumpectomy and radiation, 48 (27%) chose mastectomy, and 5 (3%) chose no treatment. Women who were educated below the collegiate level were more likely to prefer breast conservation therapy compared with those with a college education and above (adjusted OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.0, 3.6). Overall, most women surveyed (62%) were concerned with cancer recurrence followed by the side effects of radiation therapy (19%). Most women surveyed (63%) would make their physician principal advisor, whereas some (23%) would make their significant other the principal advisor. More women who chose mastectomy would make their physician their principal advisor (80%) versus those who chose lumpectomy (65%). More than 80 per cent of the women surveyed would have their physician decide their treatment. The women in the present study exhibited a distinct preference for breast conservation therapy over mastectomy

Microscopic examination did not show any connection to the primary tumor. The different possibilities of pathogenesis (bloodborn metastasis to the same globe, episcleral metastasis by conjunctival lymphatics, surgical dissemination due to the suturing of tantalum marks around the primary tumor) are discussed. The ciliary melanoma has spread over the iris despite the irradiation, probably as a result of insufficient irradiation of its anterior border. The results of histologic examination of the partially necrotic, partially viable irradiated tumor are considered with regard to the conservative tumor therapy administered

The treatment volumes for 13 NSCLC patients undergoing radical radiotherapy were planned using the five different techniques and dose-volume histograms (DVH) were used extensively in the comparative analysis. The minimum dose to the phase 2 target volume was escalated to 90 Gy, or until the point at which pre-set tolerance limits of spinal cord or lung were exceeded. The proton plan could treat nine of the 13 patients up to a dose of 90 Gy. Among the four X-ray techniques, performance varied enormously. One of them could not treat any of the patients, even to the conventional 60 Gy level, without failing to meet one or more of the criteria, whilst another one could treat 10 out of the 13 patients, although with this technique only four were permitted to have the dose escalated to 90 Gy. It was also found that two of the 13 patients could not be treated by any of the proton or X-ray plans to the conventional level, and were therefore considered unsuitable for radical radiotherapy. Various issues in conformal NSCLC radiotherapy including organ movement, tumour control, other possible organs at risk etc., are also discussed

Of 562 eyes treated over a 10-year period with pretreatment visual acuity of 20/200 or better, 363 (64.6%) contained tumors within 2 disc diameters (DD) of the disc or fovea. Rates of visual loss after treatment to worse than 20/200 and causes of visual decline were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Cumulative rates of visual loss among subjects with tumors near the disc or fovea were 33 and 47% 1 and 2 years after treatment compared to 17 and 28%, respectively, for subjects with tumors located farther from both structures. The leading cause of visual loss in the first year among eyes with tumors near the disc or fovea was retinal detachment. Controlling for other predictors of visual loss to worse than 20/200, location near the disc or fovea was independently related to visual loss primarily due to retinal detachment, cataract, and radiation retinopathy. Despite the unfavorable location of these tumors, over half of patients with 20/200 or better pretreatment visual acuity had useful vision 2 years after treatment

METHODS AND MATERIALS: In 5 patients, comparative treatment planning was performed by comparing proton plans and related conventional, conformal, and IMRT photon plans. The evaluations analyzed dose-volume histogram findings of the target volumes and organs at risk (OARs, i.e., pituitary gland, optical pathway structures, brain, nontarget tissue). RESULTS: The mean and maximal doses, dose inhomogeneities, and conformity indexes for the planning target volumes were comparable for all techniques. Photon plans resulted in greater volumes of irradiated nontarget tissues at the 10-70% dose level compared with the corresponding proton plans. The volumes thereby increased by a factor of 1.3-3.1 for conventional, 1.1-3.8 for conformal, and 1.1-3.7 for IMRT. Compared with conventional techniques, conformal and IMRT photon treatment planning options similarly reduced the mean dose to the OARs. The use of protons further reduced the mean dose to the OARs by up to 65% and 62% compared with the conformal and IMRT technique, respectively. CONCLUSION: Compared with conventional treatment techniques, conformal RT and IMRT similarly enabled dose reductions to the OARs. Additional improvements were obtained using proton-based treatment planning modalities

We present our initial experience with protons for three-dimensional, conformal, external-beam accelerated partial breast irradiation (3D-CPBI). METHODS AND MATERIALS: From March 2004 to June 2005, 25 patients with tumors < or =2 cm and negative axillary nodes were treated with proton 3D-CPBI. The prescribed dose was 32 Cobalt Gray Equivalents (CGE) in 4 CGE fractions given twice daily. One to three fields were used to provide adequate planning target volume (PTV) coverage and dose homogeneity. RESULTS: Excellent PTV coverage and dose homogeneity were obtained in all patients with one to three proton beams. The median PTV receiving 95% of the prescribed dose was 100%. Dose inhomogeneity exceeded 10% in only 1 patient (4%). The median volume of nontarget breast tissue receiving 50% of the prescribed dose was 23%. Median volumes of ipsilateral lung receiving 20 CGE, 10 CGE, and 5 CGE were 0%, 1%, and 2%, respectively. The contralateral lung and heart received essentially no radiation dose. Cost analysis suggests that proton 3D-CPBI is only modestly more expensive (25%) than traditional whole-breast irradiation (WBI). CONCLUSION: Proton 3D-CPBI is technically feasible, providing both excellent PTV coverage and normal tissue sparing. It markedly reduces the volume of nontarget breast tissue irradiated compared with photon-based 3D-CPBI, addressing a principle disadvantage of external-beam approaches to PBI. As proton therapy becomes more widely available, it may prove an attractive tool for 3D-CPBI

Endoresection of the tumour after proton beam irradiation, is an alternative approach, aiming to reduce the incidence of ocular morbidity caused by tumour necrosis after sole radiotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 32 patients with large uveal melanomas (mean tumour thickness: 9.1 mm, mean tumour volume: 0.77 cc), received a primary proton beam irradiation (60 CGE) and underwent subsequent endoresection via a 3-port pars plana vitrectomy. The median pretreatment visual acuity was 0.2. The mean follow-up was 13.9 months. RESULTS: The postoperative visual acuity after 12 months was 0.12 (median, mean visual acuity loss 0.08). The probability of developing radiation retinopathy or papillopathy within the first year after treatment was 35% and 28% respectively and the probability of enucleation was 9% within the first postoperative year. No tumour recurrences were observed and 2 patients developed liver metastases. CONCLUSIONS: Endoresection following irradiation of large uveal melanomas located close to the optic nerve and/ or the fovea seems to be a useful and safe alternative to the traditional irradiation or enucleation. The incidence of complications following our approach seems to be lower when compared to radiation alone, where tumour necrosis is a substantial problem

Overall survival, local control, complications, and predictive parameters are analyzed. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fourteen patients with sacral chordomas were treated with the charged particles helium and neon between 1977 and 1989. The median dose was 7565 cGyE and the median follow up is 5 years. All patients were treated post-operatively; ten had gross residual disease. RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier survival at 5 years is 85%. Overall 5-year local control is 55%. A trend to improved local control at 5 years was seen in patients treated with neon when compared to patients treated with helium (62% vs 34%), in patients following complete resection versus patients with gross residual tumor (75% vs 40%), and in patients who had treatment courses under 73 days (61% vs 21%). Distant metastases were seen in two patients (14%). No patient developed neurologic sequelae or pain syndromes. One previously irradiated patient required colostomy, one patient had delayed wound healing following a negative post-radiation biopsy, and one patient developed a second malignancy. There were no genitourinary complications. CONCLUSION: Our experience indicates that post-operative charged particle irradiation of sacral chordomas appears to result in reasonable local control and survival with acceptable risk, and that additional evaluation on the use of heavy charged particles is warranted	
1	2284	Acute skin reactions observed in fractionated proton irradiation	Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Humans, Japan, Protons, Radiation, Radiodermatitis/et [Etiology], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/ae [Adverse Effects], Relative Biological Effectiveness, Skin, Skin/re [Radiation Effects], Time, Universities, X-Rays	Between May 1985 and July 1987, 49 skin reactions of 43 patients treated by proton irradiation were observed at the Particle Radiation Medical Science Center (PARMS), The University of Tsukuba. Taking the peak skin score as an endpoint, the radiobiological effects [relative biological effectiveness (RBE) and time-dose relationships] of the proton beam in multi-fractionated treatments were estimated. Factors influencing the skin dose, such as the prescribed tumor dose, tumor site, and number of applied fields, were also analyzed. The following conclusions regarding acute skin reactions to the clinical use of proton irradiation were obtained: 1) the physical skin-sparing effect of proton irradiation in single-field irradiation, especially in superficial regions, is not large compared with that of high-energy photon irradiation; 2) multidirectional proton irradiation significantly reduced the skin dose and severity of acute reactions; 3) the radiobiological effects of the proton beam, RBE and the time factor, estimated in human skin in multi-fractional treatment were slightly smaller than those of X-rays, i.e., 0.92 and -0.25 +/- 0.09, respectively

We report our experience with stereotactic radiosurgery in nine patients with ten glomus tumors. All patients were treated either with frame based LINAC or Cyberknife with doses ranging from 1600 cGy to 2500 cGy. Three patients received no previous therapy and one patient received additional external beam radiation for concomitant treatment of carotid body tumors. Patients were then followed for post treatment side effects in addition to change in tumor size by MRI evaluation. The median clinical follow-up time was 26 months (mean 54 months), median radiographic follow-up was 21.5 months (mean 46 months), with a range from 3 to 126 months. The results from our center demonstrated nine of ten tumors to be stable in size by MRI exam, and one tumor which regressed in size. Nine patients had stable neurological symptoms, and one patient experienced transient ipsilateral tongue weakness and hearing loss, both of which subsequently resolved. Our results continue to support radiosurgery as a suitable form of treatment for glomus jugulare tumors as evidenced by results from this four and a half year follow-up

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between January 2001 and February 2006, 59 patients with locally advanced or unfavorably located choroidal melanoma were enrolled in a Phase I/II clinical trial of carbon-ion radiotherapy at the National Institute of Radiologic Sciences. The primary endpoint of this study was normal tissue morbidity, and secondary endpoints were local tumor control and patient survival. Of the 59 subjects enrolled, 57 were followed >6 months and analyzed. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients (40%) developed neovascular glaucoma, and three underwent enucleation for eye pain due to elevated intraocular pressure. Incidence of neovascular glaucoma was dependent on tumor size and site. Five patients had died at analysis, three of distant metastasis and two of concurrent disease. All but one patient, who developed marginal recurrence, were controlled locally. Six patients developed distant metastasis, five in the liver and one in the lung. Three-year overall survival, disease-free survival, and local control rates were 88.2%, 84.8%, and 97.4%, respectively. No apparent dose-response relationship was observed in either tumor control or normal tissue morbidity at the dose range applied. CONCLUSION: Carbon-ion radiotherapy can be applied to choroidal melanoma with an acceptable morbidity and sufficient antitumor effect, even with tumors of unfavorable size or site

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Intensity modulated radiotherapy treatment (IMRT) plans were designed for nine patients using the CORVUS treatment planning system (NOMOS Corp.). These plans were delivered using a tertiary collimator dedicated for serial tomotherapy attached to a 10-MV linear accelerator. For each patient, one optically stimulated luminescence dosimeter (OSLD) was placed on the sternum and one on the lower abdomen. The OSLDs were then processed, thereby estimating the in vivo absorbed doses to the sternum and gonads as a function of distance from the treatment site. RESULTS: The OSLDs were shown to measure known doses to within 5%, thereby validating their accuracy for this dose and energy range. In the patient studies, the dose received by the OSLDs varied in direct proportion to the number of monitor units delivered and inversely with the distance from the target volume; the patient dose at a distance of 15 cm from the target is approximately 0.4% of the total monitor units delivered, and drops to below 0.1% of the total MUs at approximately 40 cm from the center of the target. The average sternal dose was 1353 mSv and the average abdominal dose was 327 mSv for an average prescribed dose of 60.1 Gy. This can be attributed, at least partially, to the inefficient treatment delivery that on average required 9.9 MU/0.01 Gy. CONCLUSIONS: While IMRT reduces the normal tissue volume in the high-dose region, it also increases the overall monitor units delivered, and hence the whole-body dose, when compared with conventional treatment delivery. As has been noted in existing literature, these increases in whole-body dose from radiotherapy delivery may increase the likelihood of a radiation-induced secondary malignancy. Therefore, it is important to assess the risk of secondary malignancies from IMRT delivery, and compare this relative risk against the potential benefits of decreased normal tissue complication probabilities

The proximity of both kidneys and the liver, and a more complex target configuration, can pose a dosimetric challenge for conventional X-ray treatment and intraoperative irradiation. We utilized proton radiation therapy (PRT) to reduce dose to uninvolved kidneys, liver, intestine, and spinal cord. PROCEDURE: A 4-year-old male underwent PRT for neuroblastoma of the right adrenal gland, following chemotherapy and delayed surgical resection. Clinical target volume (CTV), boost volume, and normal structures were outlined on the 3D treatment planning CT scan. The patient received 25.2 CGE (cobalt Gray equivalent) to the CTV and 34.2 CGE to the boost region, using 1.8 CGE per fraction, five treatments per week. Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) were obtained for target and nontarget structures. RESULTS: The 95% isodose volume enclosed CTV and boost volumes. The dose to 50% of the ipsilateral kidney, with tumor involvement of the medial renal surface, was < or = 16 CGE (47% of prescribed total dose). Doses to 50% and 20% of the contralateral kidney in close proximity to deep left-side, paraspinal soft tissue involvement were restricted to 1 CGE and 10 CGE, respectively. Eighty percent of the liver received 27 CGE (80% of prescribed dose). Using a patch technique, unique to charged particle therapy, the spinal cord was almost completely spared during boost volume irradiation. CONCLUSIONS: PRT can achieve excellent dose conformity for advanced retroperitoneal, paraspinal lesions, while respecting normal tissue tolerance levels. Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc

METHODS: The primary endpoint was acute grade 3 or greater genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities. The study included patients with clinical stage T1-3N0M0 prostate cancer. Radiotherapy consisted of 50 Gy/25 fx photon irradiation to the prostate and the bilateral seminal vesicles followed by proton boost of 26 Gy(E)/13 fx to the prostate alone. Hormonal therapy was allowed before and during the radiation therapy. RESULTS: Between January 2001 and January 2003, 30 patients were enrolled in this study. Acute grade 1/2 GU and GI toxicities were observed in 20/4 and 17/0 patients, respectively. With the median follow-up period of 30 months (range 20-45), late grade 1/2 GU and GI toxicities occurred in 2/3 and 8/3 patients, respectively. No grade 3 or greater acute or late toxicities were observed. All patients were alive, but six patients relapsed biochemically after 7-24 months. CONCLUSIONS: Proton boost therapy following photon radiotherapy for prostate cancer is feasible. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of proton beam therapy, a multi-institutional phase II trial is in progress in Japan

METHODS AND MATERIALS: We followed 11 patients receiving an exclusive external radiation therapy for brain tumor for 8 months. They underwent proton MRS scans before any radiation exposure and 1, 4, and 8 months after they began the radiation therapy. The patients received 60 Gy in tumoral area fractionated over 6 weeks. The contralateral normal brain hemisphere received a radiation dose from 20 to 50 Gy. The main metabolite concentrations (N-acetylaspartate (NAA), choline compounds (Cho), creatine (Cr), and lactate (Lac) were evaluated by the areas of the peaks after peak fitting. Normalized values (NV) were obtained by processing the ratio of the peak area of a given metabolite to the sum of all the spectrum peak areas; ratios (NAA/Cho, NAA/Cr, and Cho/Cr) were processed. One patient, who received panencephalic radiotherapy (30 Gy) after metastasectomy from a primary kidney adenocarcinoma, has been monitored with 1H-MRS eight times for 6 months to observe the onset of the metabolic changes. RESULTS: Changes were observed in irradiated normal brain tissue 4 months after radiation therapy began: the NAA/Cho and NAA/Cr ratios and the NAA (NV) decreased while the Choline (NV) increased. Four months later, normal values were recovered. CONCLUSION: 1H-MRS has the potentiality to detect and to evaluate in vivo early adverse metabolic effects of radiation therapy in the normal human brain. These changes are significant 4 months after the radiation therapy began and appear to resolve over time

Proton beam radiotherapy was applied to the lesion, since surgery was contraindicated. The total dose to the stomach lesion was 61 Gy in 7 wk. The tumor on the stomach regressed, with flattening of the round wall of the lesion. The reactive changes of the proton beam radiotherapy, based on the histopathological examination, revealed extensive tumor necrosis and sparing of vital architecture of normal tissue around the irradiated tumor tissue. Only small clusters of vital or devitalized tumor cells with less than approximately 5% of the whole tumor tissue remained after treatment. We suggest that a high dose of radiation delivered by well-defined proton field could result in an improved therapeutic outcome without undue risk of injury to normal tissue

Both techniques provide excellent coverage of the target volume with neon ion and proton beams. The advantage of variable modulation is that less dose is delivered proximal to the target volume. For tumors in the gastrointestinal tract, this implies that less dose is given to the liver, gut, kidneys, and lungs. For the ten patients considered in this study, variable-modulation reduced the total integral dose by an average of 17% for neon ion beams and by 18% for protons as compared to fixed-modulation. If the tumor volume is excluded, the reduction in the integral dose to normal tissues ranged from 15% to 32% for neon ions and from 18% to 34% for proton beams. These gains are larger than those anticipated on the basis of an analytic study by Goitein and Chen [Med. Phys. 10, 831-840 (1983)], which predicted integral dose reductions of the order of 10% for protons and 14% for neon ions. They are also larger than those reported in a similar study by Urie and Goitein [Med. Phys. 16, 593-601 (1989)] for proton irradiation of skull-base tumors. This is probably because the tumors in the GI tract considered in this study were more irregularly shaped than Goitein and Chen's analytic model assumes. The results of this study also suggest that due to increased sparing of normal tissues, the number of different portal directions required to achieve a satisfactory treatment plan will be reduced for variable-modulation beam delivery systems. This implies that variable-modulation treatment plans will be easier to execute than current fixed-modulation plans

[Japanese]	Aged, Carbon, Combined Modality Therapy, Female, Humans, Ions, Lung, Male, Middle Aged, Pancreatectomy, Pancreatic Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Pancreatic Neoplasms/th [Therapy], Prognosis, Prostate, Radiation, Radiotherapy,Adjuvant/mt [Methods], Recurrence	Prognosis of pancreatic cancer is still remarkably poor, even if complete resection was performed by enlarged abscission. On the other hand, carbon-ion beam therapy is giving good results in some selected carcinoma such as small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, uterus cancer, and soft tissue/bone tumor. In this report, we discuss four patients with pancreatic cancer treated by surgical pancreatectomy combined with preoperative carbon-ion beam irradiation. All patients were irradiated with 48 GyE carbon-iron beam by HIMAC (Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba) to the pancreatic area including lymph nodes and nerve plexus. Severe cholangitis, as the postoperative complication, had occurred in one of the patients. However, there was no complication or disorder caused by carbon-iron radiation. All four patients are alive now, but two of them developed tumor recurrence, one with hepatic metastasis and the other with peritoneal dissemination. Surgical treatment for pancreatic cancer combined with preoperative carbon-ion irradiation is expected as a promising cure, but it is necessary to examine more cases in the future to evaluate the clinical outcome of this treatment

In operable rectal cancer intensive irradiation at a single focal dose of 6.5 Gy and summary dose of 19.5 Gy (3 daily fractions), in operable colonic cancer 4 and 20 Gy (5 daily fractions respectively). The five-year survival rate attained during combined treatment of rectal cancer exceeded that after radical operations by 30%. Fractional-extended irradiation at a single focal dose of 4 Gy and summary dose of 40 Gy (every other day) in 44.6% of the patients permitted one to make locally disseminated rectal cancer resectable. Preoperative irradiation of locally disseminated rectal cancer with a preliminary synchronization of the tumor cell division cycle with 5-fluorouracil (a single focal dose of 6 Gy, summary dose of 36 Gy for irradiation twice a week) was well tolerated by the patients, and its effect on tumors was more noticeable as compared to radiotherapy only. Marked radiation reactions were absent in colonic cancer, radical operation (hemicolectomy) entailed no additional difficulties. Local recurrences were not noted in either of 10 patients who had been followed-up in the course of 1 year

[German]	Artifacts, Dose Fractionation, Humans, Knowledge, Male, Movement, Particle Accelerators, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiation, Radiation Protection, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/is [Instrumentation], Rectum, Software, Uncertainty	BACKGROUND: Conformal radiotherapy techniques as used in prostate treatment allow to spare normal tissue by conforming the radiation fields to the shape of the planning target volume (PTV). To be able to fully utilize the advantages of these techniques correct patient positioning is an important prerequisite. This study employing an electronic portal imaging device (EPID) investigated the positioning uncertainties that occur in the pelvic region for different patient positioning devices. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 15 patients with prostate cancer were irradiated with or without rectal balloon/pelvic mask at a linear accelerator with multileaf collimator (MLC). For each patient multiple portal images were taken from different directions and compared to the digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) of the treatment planning system and to simulation films (Table 1, Figure 1). RESULTS: In spite of different positioning devices, all patients showed comparable total positioning uncertainties of 4.0 mm (lateral), 4.5 mm (cranio-caudal) and 1.7 mm (dorso-ventral). The lateral positioning error was reduced for the pelvic mask patients while the cranio-caudal error increased (Table 2, Figure 2). A systematic and a random component sum up to the total positioning error, and a good estimate of the magnitudes of the two is possible from six to eight portal images (Figure 3). CONCLUSIONS: With a small number of portal images it is possible to find out the systematic and random positioning error of a patient. Knowledge of the random error can be used to resize the treatment margin which is clinically relevant since this error differs greatly for different patients (Figure 4). Image analysis with EPID is convenient, yet has some problems. For example, one only gets indirect information on the movement of the ventral rectum wall (Figure 5). The successful operation of positioning devices, although, needs further improvement--especially if one focuses on IMRT

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Analyses were performed for 1255 patients treated between October 1991 and December 1997. Outcomes were measured on primarily in terms of biochemical relapse and toxicity. RESULTS: The overall biochemical disease-free survival rate was 73%, and was 90% in patients with initial PSA <or=4.0; it was 87% in patients with posttreatment PSA nadirs <or=0.50. Rates dropped with rises in initial and nadir PSA values. Long-term survival outcomes were comparable with those reported for other modalities intended for cure. CONCLUSIONS: Conformal proton radiation therapy at the reported dose levels yielded disease-free survival rates comparable with other forms of local therapy, and with minimal morbidity. Dose-escalation strategies are being implemented to further improve long-term results

A 74-year-old patient was diagnosed with prostate cancer 10 years ago and started on the endocrine therapy with LH-RH agonist. He had no apparent distant metastasis, and received radiation therapy 8 years ago. He has complained of low back pain since several months ago. A high uptake on bone scintigram and osteolytic and osteoblastic damages on CT were noted in pubic bone and sacrum. The PSA level was less than 0.2 ng/ml. Pathohistological diagnosis by biopsy of the pubic bone was chondroblastic type osteosarcoma, showing an atypical cell proliferation with osteoid. Immunostaining for nonepithelial marker vimentin was positive. He underwent heavy ion radiation therapy for osteosarcoma at the National Institute of Radiological Sciences. Osteosarcoma is one of the rare delayed complications after radiation therapy and requires biopsy for correct diagnosis

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The records of 96 consecutive patients treated at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory (HCL) between June 1984 and 1993, for chordomas and chondrosarcomas of the base of the skull were reviewed. All the patients had undergone some degree of resection of the tumor prior to radiation therapy. Seventy-five patients were classified as "primary tumors" and 21 as recurrent or regrowing tumors after one or more surgical procedures. All the patients were randomized to receive 66.6 or 72 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE) on a prospective dose-searching study by proton and photon irradiation (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group #85-26) with conventional fractionation (1.8 CGE/day, 5 fractions/week). All treatments were planned using the three-dimensional (3D) planning system developed at the Massachusetts General Hospital, and the dose was delivered using opposed lateral fields for the photon component and a noncoplanar isocentric technique for the proton component. Clinical symptoms of TL damage were classified into 4 grades. Computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were evaluated for white matter changes. Abnormalities associated with persistent or recurrent tumor were distinguished from radiation-induced changes. TLs were delineated on the original scans of the 10 patients with damage and those of a group of 33 patients with no clinical or MRI evidence of injury. Dose distributions were calculated and dose-volume histograms were obtained for these patients. RESULTS: Of the patients, 10 developed TL damage, with bilateral injury in 2 and unilateral injury in 8. The cumulative TL damage incidence at 2 and 5 years was 7.6 and 13.2%, respectively. The MRI areas suggestive of TL damage were always separated from the tumor bed. Symptoms were severe to moderate in 8 patients. Several baseline factors, tumor- or host-related, were analyzed to evaluate their predictivity for TL damage: age, gender, tumor site, histology, type of presentation, type and number of surgical procedures, primary tumor volume, prescribed dose, normal tissue involvement, and volume of TL receiving doses ranging between 10 and 50 CGE or more. Only gender, in a univariate analysis (log rank) was a significant predictor of damage (0.0155), with male patients being at significantly higher risk of TL injury. In a stepwise Cox regression that included gender as a variable, no other baseline variable improved the prediction of damage. CONCLUSIONS: The 2- and 5-year cumulative TL damage rates were 7.6 and 13.2%, respectively. Despite the different TL damage rates related to age, tumor volume, number of surgical procedures prior to radiation therapy, and prescribed doses to the tumor, only gender was a significant predictor of damage (p = 0.0155) using a univariate (log rank) test. Chordomas and chondrosarcomas of the base of the skull may represent an interesting model to evaluate the TL damage rates because of their extradural origin, displacing the white matter instead of infiltrating it as gliomas do, because of their longer local recurrence-free survival other than gliomas and other brain tumors and because of the high doses of irradiation delivered to the target volume to obtain local control

0	4706	Gemcitabine-related radiation recall in a patient with pancreatic cancer	Antimetabolites,Antineoplastic/ae [Adverse Effects], Breast, Combined Modality Therapy, Connecticut, Deoxycytidine/aa [Analogs & Derivatives], Deoxycytidine/ae [Adverse Effects], Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage/et [Etiology], Hematocrit, Humans, Liver, Lung, Male, Middle Aged, Pancreatic Neoplasms/dt [Drug Therapy], Pancreatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Physical Examination, Radiation, Radiation Injuries, Radiation Injuries/pp [Physiopathology], Time, Universities	Radiation recall refers to inflammatory reactions triggered by chemotherapeutic agents and develops cutaneously in the previously irradiated areas. Such agents include anthracyclines, taxanes and capecitabine. Radiation recall related to gemcitabine has been reported in lung and breast cancer. Similar phenomenon associated with gemcitabine, the only FDA-approved drug for pancreatic cancer, is rarely reported. We report a patient with inoperable pancreatic cancer who developed gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to radiation-recall related to gemcitabine and review literature. A 57-year-old white male with unresectable pancreatic cancer received capecitabine in combination with radiation therapy followed by capecitabine alone given over approximately a 3-month time period. Computed tomography re-evaluation demonstrated a new liver lesion. The patient was then treated with gemcitabine and irinotecan. On day 15 of cycle 1, he reported progressive worsening of weakness and fatigue, and melena. Physical examination revealed hypotension (84/47 mmHg) and heme-positive stool on rectal examination. He denied aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use. Chemotherapy was held. Hematocrit was 20% (previously 33%). He was transfused with 3 units of packed red blood cells. An esophago-gastro-duodenal examination was performed which showed antritis and duodenitis consistent with radiation therapy. A single site of oozing was injected with epinephrine. The diffuse gastritis was aggressively treated with proton pump inhibitors. The patient's hematocrit eventually stabilized and was 30% at discharge. Gemcitabine was not resumed. Radiation recall from gemcitabine is rare, but can potentially arise in any site that has been previously irradiated. Gemcitabine should be added to the list of drugs known to cause radiation recall. Treating physicians must be aware of this potential toxicity from gemcitabine either given concomitantly or followed by radiation. We suggest discontinuing gemcitabine if radiation recall is observed. Further studies are warranted into the pathogenesis of this unique phenomenon

However, the survival of severe cirrhotic patients has recently improved due to advanced treatments. The aim of this study was to define the role of proton beam therapy for HCC patients with severe cirrhosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 19 HCC patients with Child-Pugh class C cirrhosis received proton beam therapy. The hepatic tumors were solitary in 14 patients and multiple in five, and the tumor size was 25-80 mm (median 40 mm) in maximum diameter. No patient had regional lymph node or distant metastasis. Total doses of 50-84 Gy (median 72 Gy) in ten to 24 fractions (median 16) were delivered to the tumors. RESULTS: Of the 19 patients, six, eight and four died of cancer, liver failure and intercurrent diseases, respectively, during the follow-up period of 3-63 months (median 17 months) after treatment. A remaining patient was alive with no evidence of disease 33 months after treatment. All but one of irradiated tumors were controlled during the follow-up period. Ten patients had new intrahepatic tumors outside the irradiated volume. The overall and progression-free survival rates were 53% and 47% at 1 year, respectively, and 42% each at 2 years. Performance status and Child-Pugh score were significant prognostic factors for survival. Therapy-related toxicity of grade 3 or more was not observed. CONCLUSION: Proton beam therapy for HCC patients with severe cirrhosis was tolerable. It may improve survival for patients with relatively good general condition and liver function

All patients were examined with standardized A and B scan ultrasonography before and after treatment with proton beam irradiation therapy. The follow-up was carried out at 1, 3, 5, 8 months and then every 6 months. The mean follow-up was 20 months (range 6-34 months). The thickness of the tumors was demonstrated to be decreased and the internal reflectivity to be enhanced in 9 out of 10 cases from 8 months after treatment till the end of the follow-up period. Histopathology confirmed in 1 eye enucleated 5 months after treatment that medium-low internal reflectivity coresponded with several areas of high cellularity and cellular mitosis. The results of our study indicate the reliability of standardized A and B scan echography in the follow-up of PCMM treated with proton beam irradiation therapy

METHODS AND MATERIALS: This study reviewed 46 patients with esophageal cancer who were treated between 1985 and 1998 using proton beams with or without X-rays. All patients had locoregionally confined disease; all but one had squamous cell carcinoma. Of the 46 patients, 40 received combinations of X-rays (median, 48 Gy) and protons (median, 31.7 Gy) as a boost. The median total dose of combined X-ray and proton radiation for the 40 patients was 76.0 Gy (range, 69.1-87.4 Gy). The remaining 6 patients received only proton beam therapy (median, 82.0 Gy; range, 75-89.5 Gy). RESULTS: The 5-year actuarial survival rate for the 46 patients, patients with T1 (n = 23), and those with T2-T4 (n = 23) was 34%, 55%, and 13%, respectively. The 5-year disease-specific survival rate for the 46 patients, those with T1, and those with T2-T4 was 67%, 95%, and 33%, respectively. The 5-year local control rate for patients with T1 and T2-T4 lesions was 83% and 29%, respectively. The site of the first relapse was locoregional for 16 patients and distant organs for 2 patients. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that proton beam therapy is an effective treatment for patients with locally confined esophageal cancer. Additional studies are required to determine the optimal total dose, fractionation schedule, and best combinations of protons and conventional X-rays with or without chemotherapy	
0	4077	Definitive proton beam radiation therapy for inoperable gastric cancer: a report of two cases	Adenocarcinoma, Adenocarcinoma/pa [Pathology], Adenocarcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Aged, Aged,80 and over, Biopsy, Humans, Japan, Male, Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Skin, Stomach Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Stomach Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Stomach Ulcer/di [Diagnosis], Stomach Ulcer/pa [Pathology], Stomach/pa [Pathology], Universities	Proton beam radiation therapy using 250 MeV protons was carried out on two patients with early gastric cancer (T1, N0, M0). One patient was an 85-year-old man with early gastric cancer of type IIa + IIc. The other one was a 70 year old man with early gastric cancer of type IIc. In both cases histological examination of biopsy specimens showed differentiated adenocarcinoma; distant metastasis was not found by other examinations. Both patients were considered inoperable due to their poor cardiac and/or respiratory functions. Therefore, it was decided to treat them by definitive proton irradiation, delivering total doses of 86 Gy and 83 Gy, respectively. In both patients, skin erythema that did not require any special treatment was found in the irradiation field. Hematobiological examinations did not show any abnormality. Although endoscopic examination at two years after irradiation in the former case and at seven months in the latter case showed persistent gastric ulcer at the site of the cancerous lesions, cancer cells were not found histologically. Therefore, we concluded that proton irradiation therapy was useful for inoperable early gastric cancers

A median dose of 5000 cGy was delivered with 4-6 Mv photons to the tumor bed and regional lymphatics in 9 patients, 1 patient received 2100 cGy to the liver in accelerated fractions because of extensive intrahepatic disease, and 1 patient received 7000 "equivalent" cGy to his pancreatic tumor bed and regional lymphatics with neon heavy particles. An Ir192 wire source later delivered a 3100-10,647 cGy boost to the site of biliary obstruction in each patient, for a mean combined dose of 10,202 cGy to a point 5 mm from the line source. Few acute complications were noted, but 3/11 patients (27%) subsequently developed upper gastrointestinal bleeding from duodenitis or frank duodenal ulceration 4 weeks, 4 months, and 7.5 months following treatment. Eight patients died--5 with local recurrence +/- distant metastasis, 2 with sepsis, and 1 with widespread systemic metastasis. Autopsies revealed no evidence of biliary tree obstruction in 3/3 patients. Mean survival time from initial laparotomy and bypass was 16.1 months, and from radiotherapy completion was 8.3 months. Evolution of radiation treatment techniques for biliary obstruction in the literature is reviewed. High-dose external-beam therapy followed by high-dose Ir192 intracavitary boost is well tolerated and provides significant palliation. Survival of these aggressively managed patients approaches that of patients with primarily resectable tumors	
1	2736	Protons or megavoltage X-rays as boost therapy for patients irradiated for localized prostatic carcinoma. An early phase I/II comparison	Clinical Trials as Topic, Disease-Free Survival, Humans, Male, Morbidity, Palpation, Pelvis, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Random Allocation, Research, Survival, Time Factors, X-Ray Therapy, X-Rays	A total of 180 patients with carcinoma of the prostate limited to the pelvis were treated with one of two external beam irradiation techniques between 1972 and 1979. One hundred and sixteen patients were treated with conventional pelvic megavoltage x-ray therapy. Sixty-four patients were treated with combined pelvic x-ray therapy plus a perineal proton beam boost to a carefully defined prostatic tumor volume. A 160 MeV proton beam has been modified to irradiate patients with localized tumors by using conventional treatment schedules. This proton beam has the physical advantage over megavoltage x-rays of reducing the dose to normal tissues adjacent to the tumor volume. By using the proton beam boost we have delivered an increased prostatic tumor dose of 500 to 700 cGy without increasing treatment morbidity at all. The two groups are actuarially analyzed for patient survival, disease-free survival and local recurrence-free survival, and thus far, no significant differences have been noted. Because of the minimal complications observed in the proton group despite a 10% increase in dose, a randomized clinical trial comparing these two treatment techniques is studied	
1	387	Experiences with an application of industrial robotics for accurate patient positioning in proton radiotherapy. [Review] [9 refs]	Electrons, Equipment Design, Humans, Industry/is [Instrumentation], Photons, Physics, Posture, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Research, Restraint,Physical/is [Instrumentation], Restraint,Physical/mt [Methods], Robotics/is [Instrumentation], Robotics/mt [Methods], Technology Assessment,Biomedical, United States	BACKGROUND: Protons beams deliver targeted radiation doses with greater precision than is possible with electrons or megavoltage X-ray photons, but to retain this advantage, patient positioning systems at proton clinics must meet tighter accuracy requirements. For this and other reasons, robots were incorporated into the treatment room systems at MPRI. METHODS: The Midwest Proton Radiotherapy Institute (MPRI) is the first radiotherapy facility in the United States to use commercial robots with six degrees of freedom for patient positioning, rather than a traditional bed with four degrees of freedom. RESULTS: This paper outlines the ways in which robots are used at MPRI and attempts to distil insights from the experience of treating over 200 radiotherapy patients with a robotic system from February 2004 to late 2006. CONCLUSIONS: The system has performed well, and with great reliability, but there is room for future improvement, especially in ease of use and in reducing the time to get patients into position.

0	989	Comparison of different external beam treatment techniques to deliver high-dose irradiation to local recurrent rectal carcinoma	Aged, Carcinoma/pa [Pathology], Carcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Female, Humans, Italy, Male, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/pa [Pathology], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/rt [Radiotherapy], Prone Position, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Rectal Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Rectal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Treatment Outcome	AIMS AND BACKGROUND: Treatment of local-regional recurrent rectal carcinoma is a challenging problem, and local control may be dose dependent; doses should probably exceed 60 Gy. Our aim was to verify the possibility to deliver 66 Gy to the target, but less than 35 Gy to the small bowel, comparing different 3D irradiation techniques, in a selected group of patients. METHODS: Five patients with local recurrent rectal carcinoma were selected as representative of different presentations of the disease. Gross tumor volume and clinical target volume were defined [by RS]. Tumors ranged between 182 and 540 cc, and small bowel volumes between 748 and 1050 cc. A three-field technique, coplanar multiple fields, noncoplanar fields and a proton beam were compared using dose volume histograms. A positive result was scored when > or = 90% of the target received the prescribed dose with no more than 5% of the small bowel receiving more than 35 Gy. Doses were escalated in steps of 2 Gy from 60 to 66 Gy. RESULTS: The number of plans fitting the constraints were 7/19, 11/19, 18/19 for doses of 66 Gy, 64 Gy and 62 Gy, respectively. The stage of the tumor did not seem to correlate with the possibility to homogeneously cover the target with the prescribed dose. CONCLUSIONS: Simple coplanar and complex coplanar techniques (up to six fields), positioning the patient in a prone position with dislocation of the bowel, seem to be the best solutions to treat almost all of the patients with doses of 64 Gy. Where higher doses are concerned, it is not possible to suggest a "standard" solution. More personalized techniques have to be tested to define the best option	
1	3649	Conservative treatment of uveal melanoma: probability of eye retention after proton treatment	Actuarial Analysis, Boston, Ciliary Body, Eye, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Immunotherapy, Male, Massachusetts, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Melanoma/su [Surgery], Ophthalmologic Surgical Procedures, Probability, Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research, Risk, Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Uveal Neoplasms/su [Surgery]	Enucleation was performed after proton treatment in 57 of 1006 (5.7%) uveal melanoma patients treated with proton beam therapy at the Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory between July 1975 and December 31, 1986. Only 2% of 99 patients with small tumors and 4% of 566 patients with intermediate size tumors underwent enucleation after treatment; 10% of 341 patients with large tumors lost the treated eye. No eyes were removed after 52 months, with 89% of enucleations performed during the first 36 months after treatment. Eye retention rates at 60 months were 89.1 +/- 3.0% for the entire group, and 97 +/- 3.7%, 92.7 +/- 3.1%, and 78.3 +/- 7.0% in patients with small, intermediate, and large tumors, respectively. Significantly greater enucleation rates were observed in patients with large tumors than in those with intermediate tumors (p = less than .0001), in patients with tumor height greater than 8 mm relative to those with tumors less than or equal to 8 mm, p = (less than .0001), with tumor diameter greater than 16 mm compared to less than or equal to 16 mm, (p = less than .0001), and with tumor involvement of the ciliary body compared to involvement of the choroid only (p = less than .0001). Possible strategies to decrease the likelihood of enucleation in patients at apparently increased risk of losing the eye after conservative therapy, that is, those with large tumors involving the ciliary body, might include a lower total dose, a more protracted treatment course, or a lower radiation dose and adjuvant treatment with chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy, with hyperthermia, or with other radiation sensitizers	
1	1897	Proton beam irradiation of subfoveal choroidal neovascularisation in age-related macular degeneration	Aged, Aged,80 and over, California, Choroidal Neovascularization/et [Etiology], Choroidal Neovascularization/rt [Radiotherapy], Cobalt, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Eye, Female, Fluorescein Angiography, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Incidence, Macular Degeneration, Macular Degeneration/co [Complications], Male, Middle Aged, Prospective Studies, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Research, Safety, Time, Universities, Visual Acuity	PURPOSE: To assess the safety and potential toxicity of proton beam radiation in the treatment of subfoveal choroidal neovascular membrane (CNVM) due to age-related manner degeneration (ARMD) in a prospective, non-randomised study. METHODS: Forty-eight eyes of 46 consecutive patients with subfoveal CNVM due to ARMD, not amenable to laser photocoagulation, were treated prospectively with a single proton beam exposure. Two dose regimens were evaluated: 8 CGE (Cobalt Gray Equivalent) and 14 CGE. Patients were followed for an average of 22.1 months after proton beam treatment. RESULTS: At the 12 month follow-up, 44% of eyes in the 8 CGE group and 75% of the eyes in the 14 CGE group had stabilized or improved visual acuity. Complex size in the 8 CGE group as measured on standard fluorescein angiography (FA), decreased or had no change initially but showed less effect over time, while the eyes treated with 14 CGE maintained decreased leakage over the follow-up period of 12 months. However, 11 eyes in the 14 CGE group experienced radiation retinopathy, with the onset between 3 and 30 months. Seven of these 11 eyes have demonstrated some visual loss but only 1 eye developed severe visual loss at 15 months after proton treatment. CONCLUSIONS: To date, 14 CGE has suggested a favourable influence on visual function and growth inhibition of CNVM. Proton beam irradiation appears to inhibit CNVM growth. The 14 CGE dose regimen appears to have a longer effect of CNVM growth than does 8 CGE, with overall stabilisation of visual function and growth inhibition. Radiation retinopathy has developed over time, but severe visual loss has been limited. On the basis of the incidence of radiation retinopathy, adjustments in the total radiation dosage and/or fractionation of the dosage should be considered

A phase-sensitive two-dimensional (2D) fast low-angle shot (FLASH) sequence was used to determine the temperature-related phase shifts during LITT. Temperature maps were displayed during therapy with a temporal resolution of 20 seconds. Irradiation was discontinued as soon as the 60 to 65 degrees C isotherm reached the margin of the tumor. A contrast-enhanced MRI study performed immediately after therapy showed a good correlation of the size of an enhancing rim around the lesion with the 60 to 65 degrees C isotherm. The preliminary results of our study indicate that MRI guidance of LITT may be improved by temperature quantification based on the proton-resonance-frequency method

The treatment volumes for 13 NSCLC patients undergoing radical radiotherapy were planned using the five different techniques and dose-volume histograms (DVH) were used extensively in the comparative analysis. The minimum dose to the phase 2 target volume was escalated to 90 Gy, or until the point at which pre-set tolerance limits of spinal cord or lung were exceeded. The proton plan could treat nine of the 13 patients up to a dose of 90 Gy. Among the four X-ray techniques, performance varied enormously. One of them could not treat any of the patients, even to the conventional 60 Gy level, without failing to meet one or more of the criteria, whilst another one could treat 10 out of the 13 patients, although with this technique only four were permitted to have the dose escalated to 90 Gy. It was also found that two of the 13 patients could not be treated by any of the proton or X-ray plans to the conventional level, and were therefore considered unsuitable for radical radiotherapy. Various issues in conformal NSCLC radiotherapy including organ movement, tumour control, other possible organs at risk etc., are also discussed	
0	1105	A treatment planning comparison of intensity modulated photon and proton therapy for paraspinal sarcomas	Cobalt, Heart, Humans, Lead, Liver, Lung, Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Research, Risk, Sarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Spinal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Stomach, Switzerland	PURPOSE: A comparative treatment planning study has been undertaken between intensity modulated (IM) photon therapy and IM proton therapy (IMPT) in paraspinal sarcomas, so as to assess the potential benefits and limitations of these treatment modalities. In the case of IM proton therapy, plans were compared also for two different sizes of the pencil beam. Finally, a 10% and 20% dose escalation with IM protons was planned, and the consequential organ at risk (OAR) irradiation was evaluated. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Plans for 5 patients were computed for IM photons (7 coplanar fields) and protons (3 coplanar beams), using the KonRad inverse treatment planning system (developed at the German Cancer Research Center). IMPT planning was performed assuming 2 different sizes of the pencil beam: IMPT with a beam of full width at half-maximum of 20 mm, and IMPT with a "mini-beam" (IMPT(M), full width at half-maximum = 12 mm). Prescribed dose was 77.4 Gy or cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE) for protons to the gross tumor volume (GTV). Surface and center spinal cord dose constraint for all techniques was 64 and 53 Gy/CGE, respectively. Tumor and OAR dose-volume histograms were calculated. Results were analyzed using dose-volume histogram parameters, inhomogeneity coefficient, and conformity index. RESULTS: Gross tumor volume coverage was optimal and equally homogeneous with both IM photon and IM proton plans. Compared to the IM photon plans, the use of IM proton beam therapy leads to a substantial reduction of the OAR total integral dose in the low-level to mid-dose level. Median heart, lung, kidney, stomach, and liver mean dose and dose at the 50% volume level were consistently reduced by a factor of 1.3 to 25. Tumor dose homogeneity in IMPT(M) plans was always better than with IMPT planning (median inhomogeneity coefficient, 0.19 vs. 0.25). IMPT dose escalation (to 92.9 CGE to the GTV) was possible in all patients without exceeding the normal-tissue dose limits. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the use of IM photon therapy, when compared to IM protons, can result in similar levels of tumor conformation. IM proton therapy, however, reduces the OAR integral dose substantially, compared to IM photon radiation therapy. As a result, tumor dose escalation was always possible with IM proton planning, within the maximal OAR dose constraints. In IM proton planning, reducing the size of the proton pencil beam (using the "mini-beam") improved the dose homogeneity, but it did not have a significant effect on the dose conformity

METHODS: The study was a retrospective nonrandomized investigation. Seventeen consecutive patients, referred to the Institut Gustave-Roussy, Villejuif, France, for circumscribed choroidal hemangioma associated with serous retinal detachment were studied. Each eye received a total dose of 20 cobalt gray equivalents (CGEs) delivered in 15-second fractions of 5 CGEs over 4 days. Functional tests included the initial and final best-corrected visual acuity, slitlamp examination, intraocular pressure, fundus examination, fluorescein angiography, and indocyanine green angiography. Tumor thickness was determined on B-scan ultrasonography. RESULTS: The macula was involved in 7 eyes and the lesion was juxtapapillary in 2 eyes. The mean (SD) tumor thickness was 3.06 (9.0) mm. The mean initial tumor diameter was 6.82 mm (range, 3.2-12.1 mm). The right eye was involved in 7 cases and the left eye in 10 cases. The mean (SD) follow-up period was 52 (58) months (range, 36-90 months). Retinal reattachment was obtained in all cases after a mean period of 2 months (range, 1-12 months; median, 1 month). Tumor regression was obtained in all cases. One recurrence occurred 1 year after the initial treatment in an undertreated area. After re-treatment, however, resolution of the retinal detachment occurred, and flattening of the choroidal lesion was obtained. Final visual acuity improved to 2 Snellen lines or more in 16 eyes (94%), was stable in 1 eye, and attained 20/40 or more in 12 eyes (70.6%). No radiation therapy complications occurred during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy for choroidal hemangiomas seems to be an effective and safe alternative option. A total dose of 20 CGEs delivered in 4 daily 15-second fractions of 5 CGEs seems adequate for local control of both the tumor and serous retinal detachment

METHODS: Four patients with unresectable solitary hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma underwent 55-82 Gy proton-beam irradiation for a period of 15-47 days. Follow-up CT including plain, enhanced and dynamic imaging was performed for a period of 9-36 months. RESULTS: Good preservation of arterial blood supply while gradual decrease in tumour size was clearly depicted by dynamic CT. CONCLUSION: We believe that preservation of hypervascularity as judged by enhancement at CT and magnetic resonance imaging, does not necessarily mean that radiotherapy in hypervascular malignant tumours has been unsuccessful

Adjustments were made for known prognostic factors including age, tumor location, tumor height, and clinical estimate of tumor diameter (for enucleated patients this was estimated in a regression equation relating histologic to clinical measurement). The overall rate ratio for all cause mortality was 1.2 (95% confidence interval, 0.9-1.6) for the concurrent enucleation series versus proton beam, and 1.6 (95% confidence interval, 1.2-2.1) for the earlier enucleation series versus proton beam. Relative rates of metastatic death, cancer death, and all cause mortality comparing alternative treatments were found to vary with time after treatment. Interval-specific rate ratios were evaluated using proportional hazards models fitted to separate time intervals after treatment. For all three outcomes, rate ratios were over two and statistically significant for the first 2 years after treatment and closer to one and nonsignificant after year 6 comparing the two enucleation groups with proton beam. Results suggest that treatment choice has little overall influence on survival in patients with uveal melanoma	
1	2912	Current results of proton beam irradiation of uveal melanomas	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Eye, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Melanoma/sc [Secondary], Methods, Middle Aged, Protons, Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Visual Acuity	Proton beam irradiation has been used for the treatment of 241 uveal melanomas over the past 7 1/2 years. Twelve melanomas (5%) were small, 99 (41%) medium, 103 (43%) large and 27 (1%) extra-large melanomas. The mean length of follow-up was 21 months and the median 15 months. Ninety-four percent of the treated lesions with a follow-up more than two years and 65% of tumors with shorter follow-up showed regression. The most recent visual acuity was 20/40 or better in 47% and 20/100 or better in 66%. Ten eyes were enucleated because of complications (9) or continued tumor growth (1). Thirteen patients developed metastases from 4 to 50 months of treatment. Our data indicate that proton irradiation can be used to treat melanomas of various sizes and in a variety of locations, and preliminary results suggest that proton therapy has no deleterious effect on the likelihood of the development of metastases

Results of a prospective study incorporating chemotherapy, surgery, and combined proton-photon radiotherapy	Adult, Aged, Boston, Cisplatin/ad [Administration & Dosage], Combined Modality Therapy, Drug Therapy,Combination, Etoposide/ad [Administration & Dosage], Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Massachusetts, Middle Aged, Necrosis, Neuroendocrine Tumors/th [Therapy], Nose Neoplasms/th [Therapy], Otorhinolaryngologic Surgical Procedures, Paranasal Sinus Neoplasms/th [Therapy], Prognosis, Prospective Studies, Protons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Recurrence, Research, Salvage Therapy, Survival, Survival Rate, Time	BACKGROUND: The authors report the results of a prospective study of patients with malignant neuroendocrine tumors of the sinonasal tract who received multimodality treatment incorporating high-dose proton-photon radiotherapy. METHODS: Nineteen patients with olfactory neuroblastoma (ONB) or neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) were treated between 1992 and 1998 on a prospective study. Four patients had Kadish Stage B disease, and 15 patients had Kadish Stage C disease. The median patient age was 44 years. Patients received chemotherapy with 2 courses of cisplatin and etoposide followed by high-dose proton-photon radiotherapy to 69.2 cobalt-Gray equivalents (CGE) using 1.6-1.8 CGE per fraction twice daily in a concomitant boost schedule. Two further courses of chemotherapy were given to responders. RESULTS: Of 19 patients, 15 patients were alive at the time of this report with a median follow-up of 45 months (range, 20-92 months). Four patients died from disseminated disease 8-47 months after their original diagnosis. The 5-year survival rate was 74%. There were two local recurrences, and both patients underwent salvage surgery. The 5-year local control rate of initial treatment was 88%. Acute toxicity of chemotherapy was tolerable, with no patient sustaining more than Grade 3 hematologic toxicity. Thirteen patients showed a partial or complete response to chemotherapy. One patient developed unilateral visual loss after the first course of chemotherapy; otherwise, visual preservation was achieved in all patients. Four patients who were clinically intact developed radiation-induced damage to the frontal or temporal lobe by magnetic resonance imaging criteria. Two patients showed soft tissue and/or bone necrosis, and one of these patients required surgical repair of a cerebrospinal fluid leak. CONCLUSIONS: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy and high-dose proton-photon radiotherapy is a successful treatment approach for patients with ONB and NEC. Radical surgery is reserved for nonresponders. Due to the precision of delivery of radiation with stereotactic setup and protons, no radiation-induced visual loss was observed	
1	2642	The effect of patient motion on dose uncertainty in charged particle irradiation for lesions encircling the brain stem or spinal cord	Biophysics, Brain, Brain Stem, California, Californium, Central Nervous System Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Chordoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Ganglioneuroma/rt [Radiotherapy], Helium, Humans, Ions, Motion, Movement, Particle Accelerators, Probability, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Spinal Cord, Spinal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Uncertainty, Universities	A specialized charged-particle radiotherapy technique developed at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (LBL) is applied to patients with lesions abutting or surrounding the spinal cord or brain stem. This technique divides the target into two parts, one partially surrounding the critical structure (brain stem or spinal cord) and a second excluding the critical structure and abutting the first portion of the target. Compensators are used to conform the dose distribution to the distal surface of the target. This technique represents a novel approach in treating unresectable or residual tumors surrounding the spinal cord or brain stem. Since the placement of the patient with respect to beam-shaping devices is critical for divided-target treatments, a method for calculating dose distributions reflecting random patient motion is proposed, and the effects of random patient motion are studied for two divided-target patient examples. Dose-volume histograms and a normal-tissue complication probability model are used in this analysis. For the patients considered in this study, the normal-tissue-complication probability model predicts that random patient motion less than or equal to 0.2 cm is tolerable in terms of spinal cord complications	
0	2466	Extended field irradiation in the treatment of patients with cervical carcinoma involving biopsy proven para-aortic nodes	Adenocarcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Adult, Aged, Aorta, Biopsy, Carcinoma,Squamous Cell/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Lead, Lymphatic Metastasis/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Mortality, Particle Accelerators, Pelvis, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/ae [Adverse Effects], Research, Survival, Survivors, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	Between November 1974 and November 1979, 15 patients with cervical carcinoma were treated with extended field irradiation for biopsy proven para-aortic lymph node (PALN) metastases. Treatment consisted of pelvic and para-aortic irradiation at a daily dose of 180 to 200 rad per day, delivering 4000 to 6000 rad to the pelvis and 4000 to 5000 rad to the para-aortic nodes. One or two intracavitary insertions each delivered an additional 2000 to 3500 rad to point A. The three year actual disease free survival for the 12 patients with Stage I and II disease was 50%. All six survivors remain alive without evidence of disease for 41 to 93 months, with a mean and median follow-up of 65 months. All patients dying of disease did so within 26 months, all but one dying within one year. All patients with Stage III and IV are dead of disease. Pelvic disease was controlled in 11 of 12 patients with Stage I or II disease, and in one of the three patients with Stage III and IV disease. There was no clinical indication of failure in the PALN in any patient. Nine patients failed with disseminated disease. Three of 15 patients (20%) suffered serious treatment-related complications. Two of these were attributed to the pelvic irradiation, with one patient requiring a colostomy. Thus, complications resulting from the extended field irradiation were seen in only one patient (6.7%). There was no treatment related mortality. Extended field irradiation can lead to a 50% survival in patients with Stage I and II cervical carcinoma and PALN metastases, a survival comparable to that reported in patients with involved pelvic nodes

[Czech]	Fibrosis, Humans, Lymphatic Metastasis, Male, Necrosis, Testicular Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Testicular Neoplasms/th [Therapy]	At the Urological Clinic in Hradec Kralove in 1975-1989 a total of 182 patients with germ cell tumours of the testis--nonseminomas were treated. Of these patients 37 were in stage III-IV (20%). In 27 (72.9%) initial chemotherapy was administered, since 1980 combined with cisplatinum, as outlined. In 20 patients also revision of retroperitoneal nodes (54%) was made, to 19 patients adjuvant chemotherapy was administered (5th and 6th cycle). In 12 patients irradiation was indicated (32.4%). Histological examination of the preparation removed from the retroperitoneum was implemented in 15 patients: in four a vital tumour was revealed, in two a mature teratoma and in nine fibrosis or necrosis of a metastatic tumour was found. In seven patient a relapse of the disease occurred, 14 patients survive for 1-15 years. Twenty-three patients died

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-one patients aged > or =80 years with HCC underwent proton beam therapy. At the time of irradiation, patient age ranged from 80 to 85 years (median, 81 years). Hepatic tumors were solitary in 17 patients and multiple in 4. Tumor size ranged from 10 to 135 mm (median, 40 mm) in maximum diameter. Ten, 5, and 6 patients received proton beam irradiation with total doses of 60 Gy in 10 fractions, 66 Gy in 22 fractions, and 70 Gy in 35 fractions, respectively, according to tumor location. RESULTS: All irradiated tumors were controlled during the follow-up period of 6-49 months (median, 16 months). Five patients showed new hepatic tumors outside the irradiated volume, 2-13 months after treatment, and 1 of them also had lung metastasis. The local progression-free and disease-free rates were 100% and 72% at 3 years, respectively. Of 21 patients, 7 died 6-49 months after treatment; 2 patients each died of trauma and old age, and 1 patient each died of HCC, pneumonia, and arrhythmia. The 3-year overall, cause-specific, and disease-free survival rates were 62%, 88%, and 51%, respectively. No therapy-related toxicity of Grade > or = 3 but thrombocytopenia in 2 patients was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy seems to be tolerable, effective, and safe for aged patients with HCC. It may contribute to prolonged survival due to tumor control	
1	4693	Cauda equina tolerance to high-dose fractionated irradiation	Actuarial Analysis, Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Analysis of Variance, Boston, Cauda Equina/re [Radiation Effects], Child, Cobalt, Disease-Free Survival, Dose Fractionation, Female, Humans, Male, Massachusetts, Medical Records, Methods, Middle Aged, Patients, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Probability, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiation Tolerance/ph [Physiology], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Conformal, Recurrence, Research, Retroperitoneal Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Retroperitoneal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Retrospective Studies, Spinal Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Spinal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Survival, Survival Rate	PURPOSE: To report late neurologic toxicity rates and clinical outcomes for patients treated with high dose fractionated radiation therapy using three-dimensional treatment planning and combined proton and photon beams to portions of the cauda equina (L2-coccyx). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Medical records of 53 patients treated to fields encompassing the cauda equina were reviewed for the onset of neurologic symptoms in the absence of local failure. All doses were normalized to equivalent dose delivered in 2-Gy fractions. Median cauda dose was 65.8 cobalt Gray equivalents (CGE) (range, 31.9-85.1). Median follow-up was 87 months (range, 14-217 months). RESULTS: Nineteen patients experienced local recurrences, and 13 others had neurologic toxicity. A total of 54% (i.e., 7/13) of the toxicities occurred 5 years or more after treatment. Median caudal dose was 73.7 CGE in the group with neurologic toxicity, and 55.6 CGE in those without. On multivariate actuarial analysis, cauda dose and gender were statistically significant for neurotoxicity at p = 0.002 and p = 0.017, respectively. The estimated tolerance doses 5 years from treatment, TD 5/5 and TD 50/5, were 55 CGE and 72 CGE, respectively, for males and 67 CGE and 84 CGE for females. The tolerance doses were about 8 CGE lower when estimated at 10 years from treatment. Disease-free survival rates at 5 and 10 years were 66% and 53%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the probability of neurotoxicity is a relatively steep function of dose to cauda equina (slope gamma50 = approximately 3). The cauda equina tolerance is greater for females than males by about 11 CGE (at 2 CGE per fraction). Extended follow-up is necessary to accurately assess neurologic damage and then differentiate that phenomenon from local recurrence; the traditional 5-year assessment has limited meaning in this population. Local control remains an issue for these patients, even with the radical doses used	
0	3235	31-P MR spectroscopy and MRI of a testicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma recurrence to monitor response to irradiation. A case report	Aged, Humans, Lymphoma, Lymphoma,Non-Hodgkin/di [Diagnosis], Lymphoma,Non-Hodgkin/pa [Pathology], Lymphoma,Non-Hodgkin/rt [Radiotherapy], Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Male, Methods, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/di [Diagnosis], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/pa [Pathology], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Recurrence, Testicular Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Testicular Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Testicular Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Testis, Testis/pa [Pathology]	PURPOSE: To monitor the metabolic changes during the radiation treatment of a recurrence of a high malignant non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) of the left testis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 76-year old patients who presented a diffuse centroblastic high malignant NHL recurrence in the left scrotal sac was examined with 31-P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and proton magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before, during and after megavoltage radiotherapy to a total dose of 56 Gy. RESULTS: The 31-P MRS spectrum of the tumor showed before starting irradiation, intensive phosphomonoester (PME) and phosphodiester (PDE) signals that overlapped the inorganic phosphate (Pi) signal. After 26 Gy irradiation, the Pi peak appeared and revealed an intratumoral pH of 7.08 very close to that in the normal testis (pH of 7.02). After 56 Gy the tumor disappeared and a complete remission was achieved. CONCLUSIONS: 1. 31-P MRS is sensitive to the changes in the tumor metabolic activity after irradiation with a dose of 26 Gy. 2. Pi and PME peaks could be good pathological markers in the steady-state response to irradiation. 3. MRI could confirm the radiation induced tumor regression and the achieved clinical complete remission

Proton beam radiotherapy was applied to the lesion, since surgery was contraindicated. The total dose to the stomach lesion was 61 Gy in 7 wk. The tumor on the stomach regressed, with flattening of the round wall of the lesion. The reactive changes of the proton beam radiotherapy, based on the histopathological examination, revealed extensive tumor necrosis and sparing of vital architecture of normal tissue around the irradiated tumor tissue. Only small clusters of vital or devitalized tumor cells with less than approximately 5% of the whole tumor tissue remained after treatment. We suggest that a high dose of radiation delivered by well-defined proton field could result in an improved therapeutic outcome without undue risk of injury to normal tissue

METHODS AND MATERIALS: This study concerns 538 patients referred by French institutions between June 1991 and December 1996. The eye and tumor parameters were measured using ultrasonography and angiography. Since 1994, CT scans were performed in most patients to help determine the axial length and the shape of the ocular globe. Tantalum clips were inserted around the tumor by the referring ophthalmologist. There were 349 posterior pole tumors (64.9%), 130 equatorial tumors (24.1%), and 59 ciliary body tumors (11%). Two hundred four patients (37.9%) had T1 or T2 tumors, and 334 patients (62.1%) had T3 or T4 tumors. The median tumor diameter was 14.6 mm, and the median tumor height was 5.1 mm. All patients received 52 Gy (57.20 Gy Co-equivalent dose) on 4 consecutive days. The data were analyzed by December 1997. RESULTS: The CSS was 77.4% at 78 months, the overall survival was 73.8% and the local control was 89.0%. The CSS was not influenced by the patient age or the site of the tumor. It was 81.5% for T1 and T2 tumors, versus 75% for T3 and T4 tumors (P = 0.035). It was found that the tumor diameter, rather than the height, was the most important parameter affecting outcome. The metastatic rate was 8%. It depended on the T stage, tumor diameter and thickness, but not the tumor site. Thirty-eight enucleations were performed, most of them due to tumor progression and/or glaucoma. One-third of the patients in whom visual acuity was adequately scored before and after treatment had a stable, if not improved vision, and half the patients retained useful vision after treatment. CONCLUSION: The outcome of patients suffering from uveal melanoma and treated with high-energy protons compares favorably with other techniques of treatment. The tumor dimensions affected CSS and metastatic rate. Even though two-thirds of patients had posterior pole tumors, half of them retained useful vision

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1974 and 1995, 367 patients with chordomas (n = 195) and chondrosarcomas (n = 172) of the base of skull have been treated with combined megavoltage photon and 160 MeV proton radiotherapy. Following 3D treatment planning with delineation of target volumes and critical nontarget structures dose distributions and dose-volume histograms were calculated. Radiotherapy was given an 1.8 Gy or CGE (=Cobalt Gray Equivalent) dose per fraction, with prescribed target doses ranging from 63 CGE to 79.2 CGE (mean = 67.8 CGE). Doses to the brainstem surface were limited to < or = 64 CGE and to the brainstem center to < or = 53 CGE. RESULTS: Follow-up time ranged from 6 months to 21.4 years (mean = 42.5 months). Brainstem toxicity was observed in 17 of 367 patients attributable to treatment, resulting in death of three patients. Actuarial rates of 5 and 10-year high-grade toxicity-free survival were 94 and 88%, respectively. Increased risk of brainstem toxicity was significantly associated with maximum dose to brainstem, volume of brainstem receiving > or = 50 CGE, > or = 55 CGE, and > or = 60 CGE, number of surgical procedures, and prevalence of diabetes or high blood pressure. Multivariate analysis identified three independent factors as important prognosticators: number of surgical procedures (p < 0.001), volume of the brainstem receiving 60 CGE (p < 0.001), and prevalence of diabetes (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Tolerance of brainstem to fractionated radiotherapy appears to be a steep function of tissue volume included in high dose regions rather than the maximum dose of brainstem alone. In addition, presence of predisposing factors as well as extent of surgical manipulation can significantly lower brainstem tolerance in the individual patient

METHODS: Four patients with unresectable solitary hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma underwent 55-82 Gy proton-beam irradiation for a period of 15-47 days. Follow-up CT including plain, enhanced and dynamic imaging was performed for a period of 9-36 months. RESULTS: Good preservation of arterial blood supply while gradual decrease in tumour size was clearly depicted by dynamic CT. CONCLUSION: We believe that preservation of hypervascularity as judged by enhancement at CT and magnetic resonance imaging, does not necessarily mean that radiotherapy in hypervascular malignant tumours has been unsuccessful	
0	1008	Potential outcomes of modalities and techniques in radiotherapy for patients with hypopharyngeal carcinoma	Carcinoma/pa [Pathology], Carcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Female, Humans, Hypopharyngeal Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Hypopharyngeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Male, Models,Theoretical, Neoplasm Staging, Probability, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Sweden, Treatment Outcome	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To determine potential improvements in treatment outcome for patients with hypopharyngeal carcinoma, T4N0M0, using proton and intensity modulated photon radiotherapy (IMRT) compared to a standard 3D conformal radiotherapy treatment (3D-CRT) in terms of local tumour control probability, TCP, and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) for the spinal cord and the parotid glands using. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using the three-dimensional treatment-planning system, Helax-TMS, 5 patients were planned with protons, IMRT, and 3D-CRT plans. The prescribed dose used was 30 fractions x 2.39 Gy for the protons and IMRT and 35 fractions x 2.00 Gy for 3D-CRT. The treatment plans were evaluated using dose volume data and dose response models were used to calculate TCP and NTCP. The target volumes were delineated to spare the parotid glands. A dose escalation was made for protons and IMRT using NTCP constraints to the spinal cord. RESULTS: On average, protons and IMRT increase TCP by 17% compared to 3D-CRT. For the spinal cord NTCP values are zero for all methods and patients. Average NTCP values for the parotid glands were >90% for 3D-CRT and significantly lower for protons and IMRT varying from 43-65%. The average parotid gland dose was 33 Gy for the protons, 38 Gy for IMRT and 48 Gy for 3D-CRT. CONCLUSIONS: Protons and IMRT gave a significant TCP increase compared to 3D-CRT while no significant difference between protons and IMRT was found. Protons generally show lower non-target tissue doses, which indicates a possibility for further dose escalation. Large individual dose differences between protons and IMRT for parotid glands indicate that some patients may benefit more from protons and others from IMRT

In extended tumours, ocular surface problems can result after therapy. In this study we examined ocular surface integrity of ten patients who underwent proton beam radiation between 1996 and 2002. METHODS: The patients were examined during their follow-up. Eight of the ten cases who underwent proton radiotherapy were recurrent tumours, which were previously treated with other adjuvant therapies. We performed a standard ophthalmological examination and detailed tear film diagnostics. RESULTS: The follow-up was 17-87 months (mean: 40.9+/-20.1). In six cases more than 50% of the upper and lower eyelids were included in the radiation field. All of these cases showed moderate to severe sicca symptoms. The impression cytology revealed squamous metaplasia of conjunctival cells in nine of ten cases. CONCLUSIONS: Squamous metaplasia of conjunctival epithelia indicates a radiogenic, persisting disturbance of differentiation of the conjunctival epithelial cells. The tear film instability correlates with the loss of mucin-secreting goblet cells and meibomian gland dysfunction	
0	639	Proton radiotherapy for orbital rhabdomyosarcoma: clinical outcome and a dosimetric comparison with photons	Brain/re [Radiation Effects], Child, Child,Preschool, Female, Humans, Infant, Male, Massachusetts, Orbital Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Rhabdomyosarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy]	BACKGROUND: Over 85% of pediatric orbital rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) are cured with combined chemotherapy and radiation. However, the late effects of photon radiation compromise function and cosmetic outcome. Proton radiation can provide excellent tumor dose distributions while sparing normal tissues better than photon irradiation. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Conformal 3D photon and proton radiotherapy plans were generated for children treated with proton irradiation for orbital RMS at Massachusetts General Hospital. Dose-volume histograms (90%, 50%, 10%) were generated and compared for important orbital and central nervous system structures. Average percentages of total dose prescribed were calculated based on the 3 dose-volume histogram levels for normal orbital structures for both the proton and photon plans. The percent of normal tissue spared by using protons was calculated. RESULTS: Seven children were treated for orbital rhabdomyosarcoma with proton irradiation and standard chemotherapy. The median follow-up is 6.3 years (range, 3.5-9.7 years). Local and distant controls compare favorably to those in other published accounts. There was an advantage in limiting the dose to the brain, pituitary, hypothalamus, temporal lobes, and ipsilateral and contralateral orbital structures. Tumor size and location affect the degree of sparing of normal structures. CONCLUSIONS: Fractionated proton radiotherapy is superior to 3D conformal photon radiation in the treatment of orbital RMS. Proton therapy maintains excellent tumor coverage while reducing the radiation dose to adjacent normal structures. Proton radiation therapy minimizes long-term side effects	
0	4217	Comparative treatment planning: proton vs. x-ray beams against glioblastoma multiforme	Boston, Brain, Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Glioblastoma, Glioblastoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Head, Humans, Image Processing,Computer-Assisted, Male, Massachusetts, Middle Aged, Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research, Survival, Survival Rate, Temporal Lobe, X-Rays	The survival of patients with glioblastoma multiforme is extremely poor, the 5-year survival rate being almost zero. The cause of failure is almost exclusively local progression of tumor, the remainder is due to complications of treatment. Although this tumor is clearly radiation resistant, there is evidence of a dose response relationship. Using a thin slice CT scan of the entire head of a patient with glioblastoma multiforme, 3-dimensional radiation treatment plans were developed for treatment to a dose of 90 cobalt-Gray-equivalent (CGE). Dose distributions using protons were compared to those using x-rays. The results showed advantages for the proton beam technique. Namely the proton plan irradiated less non-target brain than the x-ray plan; this was especially so in the decrease of coverage of deep-seated structures. The volume of non-target brain that received more than 70 CGE was 175 ml for the x-ray plan and 94 ml for the proton plan. This study indicates that for a subpopulation of patients with glioblastoma multiforme, at least 90 CGE could be delivered with proton beam techniques to the target with only small volumes of normal brain structures receiving more than 70 CGE

Analysis of combined data from the 13 patients revealed statistically significant improvement in 5 clinical indicators of disease activity at the end of TLI and 6 and 12 months later, accompanied by T4-specific immunosuppression. Management considerations resulted in the introduction of prednisone therapy in 5 patients, methotrexate in 4, and azathioprine in 1 during the interval of 8-12 months post-TLI. Herpes zoster occurred in 5 patients prior to the initiation of this additional therapy. These data indicate that, in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, a TLI dose of 2,000 cGy is sufficient to produce measurable benefit that lasts for 6 months, and that the improvement can be maintained at 12 months by the use of prednisone and methotrexate	
0	1454	Potential reduction of the incidence of radiation-induced second cancers by using proton beams in the treatment of pediatric tumors	Adolescent, Child, Humans, Incidence, Male, Medulloblastoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Neoplasms,Radiation-Induced/pc [Prevention & Control], Neoplasms,Second Primary/pc [Prevention & Control], Orbital Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Paranasal Sinus Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Rhabdomyosarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Risk, Spinal Cord Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Switzerland, X-Rays	PURPOSE: To assess the potential influence of improved dose distribution with proton beams compared to conventional or intensity-modulated (IM) X-ray beams on the incidence of treatment-induced secondary cancers in pediatric oncology. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Two children, one with a parameningeal rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) and a second with a medulloblastoma, were used as models for the purpose of this study. After defining the target and critical structures, treatment plans were calculated and optimized, four for the RMS case (conventional X-ray, IM X-rays, protons, and IM protons) and three for the irradiation of the spinal axis in medulloblastoma (conventional X-ray, IM X-rays, protons). Secondary cancer incidence was estimated using a model based on Publication No. 60 of the International Commission on Radiologic Protection. This model allowed estimation of absolute risks of secondary cancer for each treatment plan based on dose-volume distributions for the nontarget organs. RESULTS: Proton beams reduced the expected incidence of radiation-induced secondary cancers for the RMS patient by a factor of >or=2 and for the medulloblastoma case by a factor of 8 to 15 when compared with either IM or conventional X-ray plans. CONCLUSIONS: The potential for a significant reduction in secondary cancers with pediatric cancers after using proton beams (forward planned or IM) in the treatment of RMS and MBD in children and adolescents represents an additional argument supporting the development of proton therapy for most radiotherapy indications in pediatric oncology	
1	1028	Audiologic and treatment outcomes after linear accelerator-based stereotactic irradiation for acoustic neuroma	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Audiometry, Follow-Up Studies, Hearing, Humans, Hydrocephalus/et [Etiology], Middle Aged, Neuroma,Acoustic/rt [Radiotherapy], Neuroma,Acoustic/su [Surgery], Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/ae [Adverse Effects], Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Stereotaxic Techniques, Stereotaxic Techniques/ae [Adverse Effects], Treatment Outcome	PURPOSE: Although surgical excision is the traditional treatment modality for acoustic neuroma, radiotherapy (RT) is gaining momentum as an alternative. This is particularly evident in patients with useful hearing, in whom fractionated RT offers the potential for hearing preservation. Our objective was to determine the disease control, hearing preservation (via audiograms), and toxicity rates after linear accelerator-based stereotactic radiation for acoustic neuroma. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 72 acoustic neuroma patients underwent stereotactic irradiation and had at least 6 months of follow-up between October 1997 and March 2002. Of these, 45 received single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and 27 received fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT). Before treatment, all SRS patients were functionally deaf and 23 of 25 SRT patients had useful hearing in the affected ear. The minimal peripheral dose was 12 Gy and 45 Gy in all SRS and SRT patients, respectively. Tumor control, toxicity, and hearing preservation were recorded. RESULTS: The median follow-up in the SRS and SRT groups was 27 and 26 months, respectively. No tumor progression was seen after SRS and SRT. On the basis of the audiogram criteria, the 1-year and 2-year hearing preservation rate was 85% and 57%, respectively. The mean pre- and post-SRT speech recognition threshold was 20 and 38 dB, respectively. The mean proportion of pre- and post-SRT speech discrimination was 91% and 59%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Stereotactic RT achieves good local control, with acceptable toxicity. RT fractionation appears to provide encouraging rates of hearing preservation

The authors present their preliminary results on 66 patients with nonsurgical intracranial arteriovenous malformations. The doses delivered for treatment varied from 20 to 70 Gy. Doses of no more than 40 Gy were used in 80% of patients. An angiographic study was performed when the computed tomographic scan controls showed relevant modifications of the lesion volume. Total obliteration was obtained in 27 of the 41 patients (65.8%) who were followed up for at least 24 months. The percentage of the cured patients is significantly higher when a) the entire malformation is included in the 75% isodose (96%) and b) the maximum diameter of the lesion is less than 12 mm (81%). Two patients died of rebleeding at 18 and 29 months after treatment

Each patient received five proton beam treatments in eight to ten days, totalling 4,730 to 8,570 rads at the tumor. No complications occurred during the treatment or follow-up period, which, at the time of this writing, ranges from one to 24 months, with an average of 12 months. No further growth of the tumor has been observed in any patient. Different signs of tumor regression have been noted. Resolution of the serous retinal detachments that accompanied some tumors is the earliest finding. Pigment changes over the surface of the tumor and adjacent pigment epithelium is a usual initial tumor response. Fluorescein angiography initially showed decreased leakage of dye; later, destruction of the tumor's vasculature and elimination of fluorescein leakage became evident. Only large choroidal vessels remained patient. Ultrasonography revealed decreased height of the tumors postirradiation, and the radioactive phosphorus (32P) uptake test, repeated in one patient, turned negative on postirradiation measurements

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The tumor was located in the parotid gland in 59%, submandibular gland in 14%, oral cavity in 23%, and elsewhere in 5%. In 386 of 498 patients surgery was combined with radiotherapy, with a median dose of 62 Gy. Median delay between surgery and radiotherapy was 6 weeks. In the postoperative radiotherapy group, adverse prognostic factors prevailed. Elective radiotherapy to the neck was given in 40%, with a median dose of 50 Gy. Primary radiotherapy (n = 40) was given for unresectable disease or M(1), with a dose range of 28-74 Gy. RESULTS: Postoperative radiotherapy improved 10-year local control significantly compared with surgery alone in T(3-4) tumors (84% vs. 18%), in patients with close (95% vs. 55%) and incomplete resection (82% vs. 44%), in bone invasion (86% vs. 54%), and perineural invasion (88% vs. 60%). Local control was not correlated with interval between surgery and radiotherapy. No dose-response relationship was shown. Postoperative radiotherapy significantly improved regional control in the pN(+) neck (86% vs. 62% for surgery alone). A rating scale for different sites, T stage, and histologic type may be applied to calculate the risk of disease in the neck at presentation, and so indicate the need for elective neck treatment. A marginal dose-response was seen, in favor of a dose > or =46 Gy. A clear dose-response relationship was shown for patients treated with primary radiotherapy. Five-year local control was 50% with a dose of 66-70 Gy. CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative radiotherapy with a dose of at least 60 Gy is indicated for patients with T(3-4) tumors, incomplete or close resection, bone invasion, perineural invasion, and pN(+). In unresectable tumors, a dose of at least 66 Gy is advisable

METHODS: Sixteen patients, aged 7-34 years, were treated with proton-beam radiation. All had undergone at least one tumor resection. Seven patients underwent repeat resection for recurrence; one had previous x-ray radiotherapy. A daily dose of 1.8 cobalt gray equivalent was used to give a total dose in the range of 50.4-59.4 cobalt gray equivalent. RESULTS: Local control was achieved in 14 of 15 patients. Twelve of 15 patients survived. There were few acute side effects. Long-term complications included newly diagnosed panhypopituitarism, a cerebrovascular accident from which the patient fully recovered, and an out-of-proton-field meningioma in the single patient who received previous radiotherapy. DISCUSSION: Fractionated proton radiotherapy is an effective treatment for children with craniopharyngioma. Longer follow-up is needed to evaluate late complications

In extended tumours, ocular surface problems can result after therapy. In this study we examined ocular surface integrity of ten patients who underwent proton beam radiation between 1996 and 2002. METHODS: The patients were examined during their follow-up. Eight of the ten cases who underwent proton radiotherapy were recurrent tumours, which were previously treated with other adjuvant therapies. We performed a standard ophthalmological examination and detailed tear film diagnostics. RESULTS: The follow-up was 17-87 months (mean: 40.9+/-20.1). In six cases more than 50% of the upper and lower eyelids were included in the radiation field. All of these cases showed moderate to severe sicca symptoms. The impression cytology revealed squamous metaplasia of conjunctival cells in nine of ten cases. CONCLUSIONS: Squamous metaplasia of conjunctival epithelia indicates a radiogenic, persisting disturbance of differentiation of the conjunctival epithelial cells. The tear film instability correlates with the loss of mucin-secreting goblet cells and meibomian gland dysfunction

0	1607	Neutron radiotherapy for recurrent pleomorphic adenomas of major salivary glands	Adenocarcinoma, Adenoma,Pleomorphic/rt [Radiotherapy], Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Cyclotrons, Humans, Liver, Lung, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/rt [Radiotherapy], Neutrons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,Conformal, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Recurrence, Risk, Salivary Gland Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Survival, Survival Analysis, Survival Rate, Survivors, Time	INTRODUCTION: Pleomorphic adenoma is the most common neoplasm arising in the salivary glands. Surgical management is the primary therapeutic modality. With the use of modern surgical techniques, recurrence is infrequent, and facial nerve sparing is the norm. However, for patients with recurrent disease, the risk of further relapses is increased with surgical resection alone, particularly for those patients in whom multiple recurrences have already occurred. The role of adjuvant radiotherapy in this setting remains uncertain. Although neutron radiotherapy is superior to conventional radiotherapy for malignant salivary gland tumors, its role in the treatment of pleomorphic adenomas is less well defined. We report our experience using this modality for high-risk, recurrent pleomorphic adenomas. METHODS: Sixteen patients were treated with neutron radiotherapy for recurrent pleomorphic adenomas of major salivary glands from 1986 through 1993. The median age at diagnosis was 33 years (range, 11-77 years); median age at the time of neutron radiotherapy was 52 years (range, 22-77 years); median number of prior surgical procedures was 3 (range, 1-6); median duration from initial diagnosis to radiotherapy was 14.5 years (range, 3 months-30 years); median follow-up was 83 months (range, 9-144 months). The median period at risk for survivors was 96 months (defined as the interval from completion of neutron radiotherapy to last follow-up). Ten patients had evidence of gross residual disease at the time of treatment as determined by imaging studies, with nine patients having multinodular disease. RESULTS: The 10-year actuarial survival was 79%. One patient died from lung metastases 9 months after treatment; one patient died from a liver tumor of uncertain origin, but the histology could not rule out a metastasis from the previous pleomorphic adenoma; and one patient died from recurrent disease at the base of skull. The 15-year actuarial locoregional control rate was 85%. One of the two patients with locoregional recurrence had a malignant transformation into an adenocarcinoma. No statistical difference in 15-year actuarial survival (75% vs 83%, p =.82) was found comparing patients with gross residual disease vs microscopic residual disease. The actuarial 15-year locoregional control was 76% for patients with gross residual disease vs 100% for those with microscopic disease. The 15-year actuarial risk of RTOG/ESTRO nonaudiologic grade III/IV complications was 21%. No facial nerve injuries were observed as a direct consequence of neutron radiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Neutron radiotherapy offers both excellent local control rates and survival rates in patients with multiply recurrent pleomorphic adenomas that are not candidates for surgical resection, even in the presence of gross residual disease. The treatment-related morbidity is acceptable. Malignant transformations and metastases, although uncommon, may be observed in this tumor. Copyright 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc

Radiation induced change (RIC) developed within the irradiated field 40-60 months after doses of 800-1000 neuNSD or 70 TDF and in 10-20 months after doses of more than 1700 neuNSD or 100 TDF. The incidence of RIC increased significantly with increasing age. Furthermore pathological changes like oedema and infarction in the brain tissue may be an important factor for the development of RIC in the central nervous system (CNS)	
0	639	Proton radiotherapy for orbital rhabdomyosarcoma: clinical outcome and a dosimetric comparison with photons	Brain/re [Radiation Effects], Child, Child,Preschool, Female, Humans, Infant, Male, Massachusetts, Orbital Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Rhabdomyosarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy]	BACKGROUND: Over 85% of pediatric orbital rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) are cured with combined chemotherapy and radiation. However, the late effects of photon radiation compromise function and cosmetic outcome. Proton radiation can provide excellent tumor dose distributions while sparing normal tissues better than photon irradiation. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Conformal 3D photon and proton radiotherapy plans were generated for children treated with proton irradiation for orbital RMS at Massachusetts General Hospital. Dose-volume histograms (90%, 50%, 10%) were generated and compared for important orbital and central nervous system structures. Average percentages of total dose prescribed were calculated based on the 3 dose-volume histogram levels for normal orbital structures for both the proton and photon plans. The percent of normal tissue spared by using protons was calculated. RESULTS: Seven children were treated for orbital rhabdomyosarcoma with proton irradiation and standard chemotherapy. The median follow-up is 6.3 years (range, 3.5-9.7 years). Local and distant controls compare favorably to those in other published accounts. There was an advantage in limiting the dose to the brain, pituitary, hypothalamus, temporal lobes, and ipsilateral and contralateral orbital structures. Tumor size and location affect the degree of sparing of normal structures. CONCLUSIONS: Fractionated proton radiotherapy is superior to 3D conformal photon radiation in the treatment of orbital RMS. Proton therapy maintains excellent tumor coverage while reducing the radiation dose to adjacent normal structures. Proton radiation therapy minimizes long-term side effects

Helium ion treatment of tumors adjacent to critical central nervous system structures	Aged, Brain, Brain Stem, Chondrosarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Chordoma, Chordoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Helium, Humans, Immobilization, Ions, Meningeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Meningioma/rt [Radiotherapy], Methods, Middle Aged, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Risk, Skull, Skull Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Spinal Cord, Spinal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	In this paper we present a technique for treating relatively small, low grade tumors located very close to critical, radiation sensitive central nervous system structures such as the spinal cord and the brain stem. A beam of helium ions is used to irradiate the tumor. The nearby normal tissues are protected by exploiting the superb dose localization properties of this beam, particularly its well defined and controllable range in tissue, the increased dose deposited near the end of this range (i.e., the Bragg peak), the sharp decrease in dose beyond the Bragg peak, and the sharp penumbra of the beam. To execute this type of treatment, extreme care must be taken in localization of the tumor and normal tissues, as well as in treatment planning and dosimetry, patient immobilization, and verification of treatment delivery. To illustrate the technique, we present a group of 19 patients treated for chordomas, meningiomas and low grade chondrosarcomas in the base of the skull or spinal column. We have been able to deliver high, uniform doses to the target volumes (doses equivalent to 60 to 80 Gy of cobalt-60) while keeping the doses to the nearby critical tissues below the threshold for radiation damage. Follow-up on this group of patients is short, averaging 22 months (2 to 75 months). Currently, 15 patients have local control of their tumor. Two major complications, a spinal cord transection and optic tract damage, are discussed in detail. Our treatment policies have been modified to minimize the risk of these complications in the future, and we are continuing to use this method to treat such patients. We are enthusiastic about this technique, since we believe there is no other potentially curative treatment for these patients

Treatment consisted of pelvic and para-aortic irradiation at a daily dose of 180 to 200 rad per day, delivering 4000 to 6000 rad to the pelvis and 4000 to 5000 rad to the para-aortic nodes. One or two intracavitary insertions each delivered an additional 2000 to 3500 rad to point A. The three year actual disease free survival for the 12 patients with Stage I and II disease was 50%. All six survivors remain alive without evidence of disease for 41 to 93 months, with a mean and median follow-up of 65 months. All patients dying of disease did so within 26 months, all but one dying within one year. All patients with Stage III and IV are dead of disease. Pelvic disease was controlled in 11 of 12 patients with Stage I or II disease, and in one of the three patients with Stage III and IV disease. There was no clinical indication of failure in the PALN in any patient. Nine patients failed with disseminated disease. Three of 15 patients (20%) suffered serious treatment-related complications. Two of these were attributed to the pelvic irradiation, with one patient requiring a colostomy. Thus, complications resulting from the extended field irradiation were seen in only one patient (6.7%). There was no treatment related mortality. Extended field irradiation can lead to a 50% survival in patients with Stage I and II cervical carcinoma and PALN metastases, a survival comparable to that reported in patients with involved pelvic nodes

METHODS: A retrospective chart and film review was performed for all patients treated for medulloblastoma at the Insitute for Neurology and Neurosurgery/Beth Israel Medical Center between August 1996 and the present. The clinical and radiographic histories of pediatric patients (ages 3-21 years at diagnosis) with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of medulloblastoma who received craniospinal radiation therapy were reviewed. Fifty-nine patients were identified, with a mean age at radiation treatment of 7.7 years and a mean follow-up time of 7.2 years. The dose to the craniospinal axis was 24 Gy (31 patients) or 36 Gy (28 patients). The radiation energy in the craniospinal axis was provided by photons in 55 patients and protons in four. All patients received a posterior fossa boost of 54 Gy (46 patients) or 72 Gy (13 patients). Twenty-six lesions developed in 18 patients (31%) during the observation period. The cumulative incidence of lesion development was 5.6, 14, and 43%, at 3, 5, and 10 years, respectively. The sites of occurrence were cerebral (20 cases) and cerebellar (six cases). There was no significant correlation between age at diagnosis, sex, craniospinal radiation dose or energy source, and lesion development. Only one patient required surgical intervention for a symptomatic hemorrhagic lesion in the frontal lobe. Histological analysis in this case was consistent with cavernoma. CONCLUSIONS: Cavernomas are common after cranial irradiation in children, and their incidence increases over time. Most of these lesions follow a benign course and do not require intervention

This study was to evaluate the influence of radiotherapy on the survival of stage IV NSCLC patients. METHODS: Clinical data of 287 patients with stage IV NSCLC were retrospectively analyzed. Whole brain was treated with two parallel fields irradiation; bone metastases were treated with one local field irradiation. Primary tumors, regional lymph nodes and other distant metastases were treated by conventional fractionation radiotherapy or 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy. Whole brain and bone radiotherapy was delivered with a total dose of 40 Gy in 20 fractions in 4 weeks or with a total dose of 30 Gy in 10 fractions in 2 weeks. The median dose for primary tumors and regional lymph nodes was 50 Gy (20-70 Gy), and the median dose for other distant metastases was 46 Gy (40-60 Gy). RESULTS: The median survival time of the 287 patients was 9 months (8-10 months). The 1- and 2-year overall survival rates were 30.2% and 8.9%. The median survival time was significantly longer in the patients received chemotherapy than in the patients didn't (10 months vs. 8 months, P = 0.049). In the patients with brain, bone, or other distant metastases, the median survival time was 8, 9, and 10 months, respectively; the 1-year survival rates were 24.8%, 28.7%, and 37.5%, respectively; the 2-year survival rates were 6.7%, 7%, and 15.3%, respectively. By unitivariate analysis, histological type and patients' age were prognostic factors of NSCLC. The median survival time was significantly longer in adenocarcinoma patients than in squamous cell carcinoma patients and other carcinoma patients (10 months vs. 7 and 9 months, P = 0.046), longer in the patients of < or =60 years old than in those of >60 years old (11 months vs. 8 months, P = 0.012), and longer in the patients with only bone metastases than in the patients with concomitant other distant metastases (10 months vs. 6 months, P = 0.033), but there was no significant difference between the patients with only brain metastases and those with concomitant other distant metastases (9 months vs. 8 months, P = 0.374). Radiotherapy for primary tumors and lymph nodes, complications of other chronic diseases, and irradiation dose and pattern had no effect on the survival. CONCLUSIONS: Histological type and patients' age may affect the efficacy of radiotherapy on stage IV NSCLC. The irradiation patterns of 40 Gy in 20 fractions in 4 weeks or 30 Gy in 10 fractions in 2 weeks have no effect on the survival of patients with brain or bone metastases

One patient was an 85-year-old man with early gastric cancer of type IIa + IIc. The other one was a 70 year old man with early gastric cancer of type IIc. In both cases histological examination of biopsy specimens showed differentiated adenocarcinoma; distant metastasis was not found by other examinations. Both patients were considered inoperable due to their poor cardiac and/or respiratory functions. Therefore, it was decided to treat them by definitive proton irradiation, delivering total doses of 86 Gy and 83 Gy, respectively. In both patients, skin erythema that did not require any special treatment was found in the irradiation field. Hematobiological examinations did not show any abnormality. Although endoscopic examination at two years after irradiation in the former case and at seven months in the latter case showed persistent gastric ulcer at the site of the cancerous lesions, cancer cells were not found histologically. Therefore, we concluded that proton irradiation therapy was useful for inoperable early gastric cancers

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Since 2004, children requiring sedation can be admitted for proton therapy at Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI), Villigen, Switzerland. Children under 5 years of age with RMS of the head and the trunk were analyzed. All children were enrolled in a multidisciplinary treatment protocol and prospective, standardized evaluation of side effects was performed. RESULTS: Nine children were included aged 0.9-3.8 years (embryonal RMS in six, and alveolar, undifferentiated or nonclassified in one each). The tumor site was parameningeal (n = 4), orbital (n = 3), head and neck (n = 1), and prostate (n = 1). All children were in IRS group III. Total proton dose was 46-54 CGE (cobalt-gray equivalent). Only the myelotoxicity exceeded grade 3 or 4 (RTOG/EORTC). CONCLUSION: Proton therapy for RMS in early children is feasible and well tolerated. The prospective standardized evaluation of toxicity and quality of life needs to be continued

Failure to control the primary tumor has been the most common cause for death. Our experience in three patients with small squamous cell cancer of the trachea treated by definitive irradiation is encouraging. The primary tumor was controlled in each patient. Histologic confirmation of tumor sterilization was observed in two. One patient remains alive and well at 54 months; one patient developed an epidural metastases at 16 months and subsequently died; and the third patient developed a separate primary lung cancer at 48 months. Two patients developed significant radiation complications

We report our experience with stereotactic radiosurgery in nine patients with ten glomus tumors. All patients were treated either with frame based LINAC or Cyberknife with doses ranging from 1600 cGy to 2500 cGy. Three patients received no previous therapy and one patient received additional external beam radiation for concomitant treatment of carotid body tumors. Patients were then followed for post treatment side effects in addition to change in tumor size by MRI evaluation. The median clinical follow-up time was 26 months (mean 54 months), median radiographic follow-up was 21.5 months (mean 46 months), with a range from 3 to 126 months. The results from our center demonstrated nine of ten tumors to be stable in size by MRI exam, and one tumor which regressed in size. Nine patients had stable neurological symptoms, and one patient experienced transient ipsilateral tongue weakness and hearing loss, both of which subsequently resolved. Our results continue to support radiosurgery as a suitable form of treatment for glomus jugulare tumors as evidenced by results from this four and a half year follow-up	
1	2643	Anterior segment sparing to reduce charged particle radiotherapy complications in uveal melanoma	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Analysis of Variance, Anterior Eye Segment, California, Californium, Eye, Eye Enucleation, Female, Glaucoma,Neovascular/et [Etiology], Helium, Helium/ae [Adverse Effects], Helium/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Male, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Methods, Middle Aged, Multivariate Analysis, Probability, Protons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Research, Risk, Risk Factors, Universities, Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	PURPOSE: The purpose of this investigation is to delineate the risk factors in the development of neovascular glaucoma (NVG) after helium-ion irradiation of uveal melanoma patients and to propose treatment technique that may reduce this risk. METHODS AND MATERIALS: 347 uveal melanoma patients were treated with helium-ions using a single-port treatment technique. Using univariate and multivariate statistics, the NVG complication rate was analyzed according to the percent of anterior chamber in the radiation field, tumor size, tumor location, sex, age, dose, and other risk factors. Several University of California San Francisco-Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) patients in each size category (medium, large, and extralarge) were retrospectively replanned using two ports instead of a single port. By using appropriate polar and azimuthal gaze angles or by treating patients with two ports, the maximum dose to the anterior segment of the eye can often be reduced. Although a larger volume of anterior chamber may receive a lower dose by using two ports than a single port treatment. We hypothesize that this could reduce the level of complications that result from the irradiation of the anterior chamber of the eye. Dose-volume histograms were calculated for the lens, and compared for the single and two-port techniques. RESULTS: NVG developed in 121 (35%) patients. The risk of NVG peaked between 1 and 2.5 years posttreatment. By univariate and multivariate analysis, the percent of lens in the field was strongly correlated with the development of NVG. Other contributing factors were tumor height, history of diabetes, and vitreous hemorrhage. Dose-volume histogram analysis of single-port vs. two-port techniques demonstrate that for some patients in the medium and large category tumor groups, a significant decrease in dose to the structures in the anterior segment of the eye could have been achieved with the use of two ports. CONCLUSION: The development of NVG after helium-ion irradiation is correlated to the amount of lens, anterior chamber in the treatment field, tumor height, proximity to the fovea, history of diabetes, and the development of vitreous hemorrhage. Although the influence of the higher LET deposition of helium-ions is unclear, this study suggests that by reducing the dose to the anterior segment of the eye may reduce the NVG complications. Based on this retrospective analysis of LBNL patients, we have implemented techniques to reduce the amount of the anterior segment receiving a high dose in our new series of patients treated with protons using the cyclotron at the UC Davis Crocker Nuclear Laboratory (CNL)

All patients underwent standardized A and B scan ultrasonography, fluorescein and indocyanine green videoangiography (FV, ICGV) before and after treatment with proton beam irradiation. The follow-up was carried out at 1, 3, 5, 8 months and then every 6 months. The mean follow-up was 26 months (range 6-46 months). The thickness of the tumors was demonstrated to be decreased and the internal reflectivity to be enhanced in 12 out of 14 cases from 8 months after treatment till the end of the follow-up period. In 2 eyes which were enucleated 5 months after treatment, histopathology confirmed that medium-low internal reflectivity corresponded to several areas of high cellularity and cellular mitosis. FV and ICGV were impossible because of opacities of dioptric media in 2 cases. From 8 months after treatment till the end of the follow-up period, in all the examined patients, FV demonstrated large hypofluorescent zones of the lesions which represented the destruction of the vascular tree of the tumor. From 8 months after treatment till the end of the follow-up period, ICGV demonstrated hypofluorescence of the lesions in 8 cases; mild hyperfluorescence and zones of colorant staining were present in late angiograms in 2 cases. The results of our study seem to confirm the reliability of standardized A and B scan ultrasonography in the follow-up of PCMM treated with proton beam irradiation; if ultrasonography is used together with FV and ICGV, the reliability of this combination is surely higher	
0	1585	Pedicled rhinotomy for clival chordomas invaginating the brainstem	Adult, California, Chordoma/pa [Pathology], Chordoma/su [Surgery], Cranial Fossa,Posterior, Dura Mater/pa [Pathology], Dura Mater/su [Surgery], Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Nasal Cavity/su [Surgery], Neoplasm Invasiveness, Nose, Radiotherapy, Retrospective Studies, Rotation, Skull Base Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Skull Base Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Treatment Outcome	OBJECT: Clival chordomas are frequently midline lesions whose posterior growth may breach the dura and invaginate the brainstem. This precludes safe delivery of potentially curative high-dose fractionated proton radiotherapy. To avoid this problem, the authors performed pedicled rhinotomy to resect chordomas in 10 patients. METHODS: Pedicled rhinotomy is a midface transnasal route to the intercarotid sella and clivus from the tuberculum sellae to the mid-C-2 level. It involves a lateral rhinotomy incision, osteotomies of nasal bones and cartilage, lateral rotation of the nose, removal of the nasal septum and medial maxillary walls, opening of ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses, and dissection of nasopharynx and oropharynx to expose the clivus and craniovertebral junction. Tumors involving the sella, medial cavernous sinuses, middle and lower clivus, and C-1 arch and dens can be removed even if they traverse the dura. Closure involves dural repair, grafting of fat and split-thickness skin, rotation of a vascularized mucosal pedicle, and reattachment of nasal cartilage. Ten clival chordomas in adult patients were surgically removed via a pedicled rhinotomy approach. Seven patients had previously undergone a total of nine skull base procedures. In eight of the 10 patients, tumors compressing the brainstem were completely removed using this technique. One patient required an additional subtemporal resection of a suprasellar tumor before definitive radiotherapy could be undertaken. No patient sustained any new neurological deficit; in eight patients headache, diplopia, or hemiparesis improved. One patient developed postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leakage and meningitis that were successfully treated with antibiotic agents and shunt placement. CONCLUSIONS: Pedicled rhinotomy provides excellent shallow-field exposure of midline clival chordomas and permits relief of brainstem compression and the postoperative administration of potentially curative proton beam irradiation

In all patients, the neoplasms had failed to respond to spinal cord tolerance doses delivered by standard external fractionated radiation therapy to a median dose of 45 Gy (range, 33-65 Gy/11-30 fractions). The tumors were treated with single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery with the spinal stereotactic frame for immobilization, localization, and treatment. The median number of isocenters was one (range, one to five) with a median single fraction dose of 10 Gy (range, 8-10 Gy) with median normalization to 80% isodose contour (range, 80-160%). There has been a single complication of esophagitis to date from radiosurgery of a tumor involving the C6-T1 segments; the esophagitis resolved with medical therapy. Median follow-up in this group of patients has been 6 months (range, 1-12 mo). To date, there has been no radiographic or clinical progression of the treated tumor in any patient. Two patients have died from systemic metastatic disease. In the three surviving patients, there has been computed tomographic- or magnetic resonance-documented regression of the treated tumor with a decrease of thecal sac compression with a median follow-up of 6 months (range, 3-14 mo). These five patients represent the first clinical application of stereotactic radiosurgery in the spine. The results suggest that extracranial radiosurgery may be suitable for the treatment of paraspinal neoplasms after external fractionated radiation therapy, even in the face of spinal cord compression	
0	3772	In vitro assessment of MR relaxation properties of pituitary adenomas	Adenoma/pa [Pathology], Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Cadaver, Cats, Female, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy/du [Diagnostic Use], Male, Middle Aged, Pituitary Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Time, Water	Proton magnetic relaxation times (T1 and T2) and bound water content were measured in vitro in pituitary adenomas from 15 patients using 90 MHz radiofrequency excitation. These data were compared with those measured in normal pituitary glands obtained from four cats and seven fresh human cadavers. The T1 and T2 measured at 24 degrees C in the tumors (mean +/- SD: 1,170 +/- 80 and 123 +/- 35 ms, respectively) were significantly higher than those of cadaver pituitary (830 +/- 200 and 76 +/- 12 ms) and cat pituitary gland (790 +/- 120 and 69 +/- 10 ms). Although the absolute values were lower, similar differences were present in T1 measured at 4 degrees C. Two-dimensional T2 versus T1 plot was particularly helpful in distinguishing tumor from the normal gland. When tumors were grouped according to density on CT, histology or previous treatment (e.g., irradiation or bromocriptine), there were no significant differences in T1 values between the groups. Bound water content was not found to correlate with T1 or T2 values. We concluded that pituitary adenomas can be distinguished from normal pituitary glands by their different relaxation properties when measured at high frequency in vitro MR

Record-linkage with the Swedish Cancer Register identified 99 new cancers more than 2 years after 131I therapy [standardised incidence ratio (SIR) = 1.43; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17-1.75] vs 122 (SIR = 1.19; 95% CI 0.88-1.42) in patients not receiving 131I. In females treated with 131I overall SIR was 1.45 (95% CI 1.14-1.83) and significantly elevated were noted for tumours of the salivary glands, genital organs, kidney and adrenal gland. No elevated risk of a subsequent breast cancer or leukaemia was noted. SIR did not change over time, arguing against a strong radiation effect of 131I. Organs that were estimated to have received more than 1.0 Gy had together a significantly increased risk of a subsequent cancer following 131I treatment (SIR = 2.59; n = 18). A significant trend was seen for increasing activities of 131I with highest risk for patients exposed to greater than or equal to 3,664 MBq (SIR = 1.80; 95% CI 1.20-2.58). No specific cancer or group of cancers could be convincingly linked to high-dose 131I exposures since SIR did not increase after 10 years of observation. However, upper confidence intervals could not exclude levels of risk that would be predicted based on data from the study of atomic bomb survivors. We conclude that the current practice of extrapolating the effects of high-dose exposures to lower-dose situations is unlikely to seriously underestimate radiation hazards for low LET radiation

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A study was performed on a group of 18 patients with cancer of the head and neck, lung, and pelvis who were treated with irregularly shaped fields. The BEV dosimetry of the fields shaped with cerrobend blocks and the MLC was measured with films at the depth of dose prescription in a solid water phantom. A "one-half-leaf" insertion convention was used to shape the MLC. In addition, an average of 15 sequential daily port films was taken per patient during the course of radiotherapy. The port films were aligned with the prescription film for each patient. Systematic error and random error of treatment setup for each patient were calculated. The effects of setup variation were incorporated by convolving the patient portal imaging data with the corresponding BEV film dosimetry. Two parameters were used to quantify the BEV dosimetry. First, the field penumbra width was calculated, which represented the average of the normal separations between 20 and 80% isodose lines along the prescription outline. Second, the ratio of areas covered by the 90 and 20% isodose lines, A90/20, was determined. The BEV dosimetry was then characterized with and without the effects of treatment setup variation. In addition, the difference in BEV dosimetry between the cerrobend block and the MLC was used to estimate the corresponding changes in tumor control probability (TCP). These changes were also compared to the changes in TCP for the treatment with or without the effects of random setup variation. RESULTS: With or without daily setup variation, the use of cerrobend block was more favorable than the MLC in terms of the field penumbra width and A90/20 for all treatment sites. In the absence of daily variation, the MLC field penumbra width was on average 1.3 mm larger than that of the cerrobend block, and 0.9 mm larger in the presence of daily setup variation. Similarly, the ratio A90/20 of the cerrobend block was on average 0.03 larger than that of MLC without daily setup variation, and 0.02 with daily setup variation. The difference in field penumbra width and A90/20 between the MLC and the cerrobend block was slightly reduced due to the effects of daily setup variation. For both the cerrobend block and the MLC, daily setup variation produced a significant increase in the field penumbra width, 2.3 mm for the cerrobend block and 1.9 mm for the MLC, and a decrease in the A90/20, 0.06 for the former and 0.05 for the latter. The change due to the daily setup variation was about a factor of 2 larger than the changes due to replacing the cerrobend block with the MLC. Using the TCP model, the change in TCP due to the daily setup variation was more than a factor of 3 larger than the change in TCP due to replacing the cerrobend block with the MLC. It was noted that the average changes in the penumbra, the A90/20 and the TCP calculated for the patient population did not adequately describe the changes for the individual patient. CONCLUSION: Our results do not show significant dosimetric differences between the MLC and the cerrobend block in conventional radiation treatment, whether or not daily setup variation was taken into consideration. The effects of daily setup variation alone produced a larger dosimetric change. The same results were obtained when the data were applied to calculate changes in TCP. For optimal radiation therapy, efforts should be concentrated on reducing daily setup variation. Our results also demonstrate the importance of frequent evaluation of MLC treatment using electronic portal imaging devices	
1	4724	Accelerated partial breast irradiation using proton beams: Initial dosimetric experience	Aged, Boston, Breast, Breast Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Breast Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Breast Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Cobalt, Costs and Cost Analysis, Feasibility Studies, Female, Heart, Heart/re [Radiation Effects], Humans, Lung, Lung/re [Radiation Effects], Massachusetts, Methods, Middle Aged, Patients, Prospective Studies, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/ec [Economics], Radiotherapy,Conformal/ec [Economics], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Research	PURPOSE: The unique dosimetric features of proton radiotherapy make it an attractive modality for normal tissue sparing. We present our initial experience with protons for three-dimensional, conformal, external-beam accelerated partial breast irradiation (3D-CPBI). METHODS AND MATERIALS: From March 2004 to June 2005, 25 patients with tumors < or =2 cm and negative axillary nodes were treated with proton 3D-CPBI. The prescribed dose was 32 Cobalt Gray Equivalents (CGE) in 4 CGE fractions given twice daily. One to three fields were used to provide adequate planning target volume (PTV) coverage and dose homogeneity. RESULTS: Excellent PTV coverage and dose homogeneity were obtained in all patients with one to three proton beams. The median PTV receiving 95% of the prescribed dose was 100%. Dose inhomogeneity exceeded 10% in only 1 patient (4%). The median volume of nontarget breast tissue receiving 50% of the prescribed dose was 23%. Median volumes of ipsilateral lung receiving 20 CGE, 10 CGE, and 5 CGE were 0%, 1%, and 2%, respectively. The contralateral lung and heart received essentially no radiation dose. Cost analysis suggests that proton 3D-CPBI is only modestly more expensive (25%) than traditional whole-breast irradiation (WBI). CONCLUSION: Proton 3D-CPBI is technically feasible, providing both excellent PTV coverage and normal tissue sparing. It markedly reduces the volume of nontarget breast tissue irradiated compared with photon-based 3D-CPBI, addressing a principle disadvantage of external-beam approaches to PBI. As proton therapy becomes more widely available, it may prove an attractive tool for 3D-CPBI

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between May 1981 and November 1996, 46 patients with partially resected, biopsied, or recurrent meningiomas (median age of 50 years; range 11-74 years) were treated with combined photon and 160-MeV proton beam therapy at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and the Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory, using computed tomography-based conformal 3D treatment planning. Nine patients were treated after incomplete tumor resection, 8 patients after tumor biopsy only, and 29 patients after tumor recurrence following gross total (10/29 patients) or progression after subtotal (19/29 patients) resection. All patients were classified as benign meningioma on review slides at MGH. The median dose to the macroscopic gross tumor volume was 59.0 CGE (range 53.1-74.1 CGE, CGE = proton Gy x 1.1 RBE). The median follow-up was 53 months (range 12-207). RESULTS: Overall survival at 5 and 10 years was 93 and 77%, respectively, and the recurrence-free rate at 5 and 10 years was 100% and 88%, respectively. Survival without severe toxicity was 80% at 5 and 10 years. Three patients presented with local tumor recurrence at 61, 95, and 125 months. One patient developed distant intradural metastasis at 21 and 88 months. No patient died from recurrent meningioma; however, 4 patients died of other causes. A fifth patient died from a brainstem necrosis after 22 months. Eight patients developed severe long-term toxicity from radiotherapy, including ophthalmologic (4 patients), neurologic (4 patients), and otologic (2 patients) complications. All patients with ophthalmologic toxicity received doses higher than those allowed for the optic nerve structures in the current protocol. CONCLUSION: Combined proton and photon radiotherapy is an effective treatment for patients with recurrent or incompletely resected benign intracranial menigiomas. Observed toxicity appears to be dose-related; with currently employed dose constraints, toxicity should not exceed that seen in patients treated with conformal fractionated supervoltage photon radiotherapy

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Since 2004, children requiring sedation can be admitted for proton therapy at Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI), Villigen, Switzerland. Children under 5 years of age with RMS of the head and the trunk were analyzed. All children were enrolled in a multidisciplinary treatment protocol and prospective, standardized evaluation of side effects was performed. RESULTS: Nine children were included aged 0.9-3.8 years (embryonal RMS in six, and alveolar, undifferentiated or nonclassified in one each). The tumor site was parameningeal (n = 4), orbital (n = 3), head and neck (n = 1), and prostate (n = 1). All children were in IRS group III. Total proton dose was 46-54 CGE (cobalt-gray equivalent). Only the myelotoxicity exceeded grade 3 or 4 (RTOG/EORTC). CONCLUSION: Proton therapy for RMS in early children is feasible and well tolerated. The prospective standardized evaluation of toxicity and quality of life needs to be continued	
1	1475	Concomitant diminishing magnetization-transfer effect and increasing choline level in radiation-induced temporal-lobe changes	Choline/me [Metabolism], Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy/du [Diagnostic Use], Male, Middle Aged, Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiation, Radiation Injuries, Radiation Injuries/di [Diagnosis], Research, Temporal Lobe/re [Radiation Effects]	This article reports on the use of both magnetization-transfer (MT) imaging and 1H-MR spectroscopy in two cases of bilateral temporal-lobe changes after radiation therapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. In the first case, the following patterns were noted: (i) although the temporal lobes appeared relatively normal on T2-weighted MR imaging, corresponding MT imaging clearly showed signal abnormalities (decreased MT effect) consistent with alterations in macromolecular structure; and (ii) concomitant strongly elevated choline on 1H-MR spectroscopy was observed, and this is associated with metabolic changes in cell membranes. The second case presented similar characteristics. In addition, there was an increased lactate signal and T2 signal changes in keeping with established oedema. Both MT and proton-spectroscopic findings were consistent with postulated pathophysiological features of radiation injury, but their specificity for this condition remains unclear. Magnetization-transfer imaging, and possibly 1H-MR spectroscopy, might be sensitive techniques for the early detection of late radiation injury

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between September 1998 and April 2002, 16 patients with histopathologically proven ACC and residual macroscopic tumor were treated with combined photon RT and a carbon ion boost to the macroscopic tumor. Median total tumor dose within the gross tumor volume (GTV) was 72 GyE. Photon radiation therapy (RT) consisted of fractionated stereotactic RT in 7 patients; 9 patients received stereotactic intensity-modulated RT. Carbon ion boost was delivered by intensity-controlled raster scanning at the heavy ion synchrotron (SIS) at the Heavy Ion Research Center (GSI) in Darmstadt. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 12 months. Three patients developed locoregional recurrences 9, 11, and 24 months after RT, respectively. Actuarial local control rates were 80.8% and 64.6% at 1 and 3 years, respectively. Overall survival rates were 100% and 83.3% at 1 and 3 years, respectively. Acute side effects greater than Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) Grade 2 were observed in 2 patients; no patient developed late effects > CTC Grade 2. CONCLUSIONS: Combined photon and carbon ion RT is feasible and effective in patients with locally advanced ACC. Acute and late toxicity is moderate with respect to the delivered tumor doses and in accordance with the radiobiologic modeling. A Phase III trial is designed

The prognosis of unresectable/metastatic adrenocortical carcinoma remains very poor because the rarity of the tumor has made it difficult to establish treatment guidelines, and diagnosis and the resultant treatment can be greatly delayed. We treated a 24-year-old woman who was diagnosed with adrenocortical carcinoma of the right adrenal gland which extended to the inferior vena cava. Although she underwent surgical resection of the extensive tumor as the primary treatment, the disease recurred in the lung and liver as multiple metastases shortly after surgery. She received intensive multimodality therapy, including chemotherapy with paclitaxel, ifosfamide, and cisplatin (TIP regimen), embolization of the feeding arteries, and proton irradiation for the liver mass. Finally, she underwent reduced-intensity allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from an HLA 1-locus-mismatched sibling donor. A prolonged survival of 39 months after the onset of the disease was achieved. Although this experience is limited, we suggest that TIP chemotherapy was effective for adrenocortical carcinoma, and a graft-versus-tumor effect after reduced-intensity stem cell transplantation may have contributed to the prolonged survival

BACKGROUND: Because of the surrounding vital structures and the difficulties in achieving wide surgical exposure, the treatment of clival lesions is challenging. In an effort to overcome these obstacles, many centers use facial incisions and osteotomies to approach clival lesions. Minimally invasive endoscopic techniques have the potential to minimize morbidity while yielding similar surgical results. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with tumors involving the clivus that underwent endoscopic resection between 2000 and 2004 were identified. Charts were reviewed for clinical characteristics, previous therapies, diagnosis, tumor extent, management modalities, length of hospital stay, complications, and outcome. RESULTS: A total of six patients were identified. There were four males and two females with a mean age of 50 years, ranging from 29 to 66 years. The most common presenting symptoms were visual disturbances. Three patients had prior craniotomy with subtotal tumor resection. The pathology included three clival chordomas, and one each of meningioma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, and sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma. All patients were managed with computer-aided transnasal endoscopic tumor resection with neurosurgical standby or involvement. None of the patients required additional craniotomies. The mean follow-up was 13 (range, 8-24) months. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy was used in three patients, and two patients are currently undergoing proton beam radiation therapy (PBRT). The average length of hospital stay was 2 (range, 2-3) days. There were no major postoperative complications. At the last follow-up, five patients were alive with two patients being free of disease. Two patients with residual disease are currently undergoing PBRT, and one patient developed distant metastasis. One patient died of unrelated causes. CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary report suggests that transnasal endoscopic management of clival lesions is a viable option to traditional open approaches with acceptable morbidity and mortality. The use of computer-aided surgery further minimizes surgical risks while maximizing tumor resection

In the present study, we focus on posttreatment radiographic lung damage: specifically, its timing, features, and relation to dose-volume factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-three patients with 44 Stage I non-small-cell lung cancers were treated with carbon ion irradiation ranging from 59.4 to 95.4 photon Gy equivalent dose (GyE) in 18 fractions over 6 weeks, according to our dose escalation protocols. Primary lesions were irradiated by 2-4 portals. Follow-up evaluation with computed tomography (CT) was sequentially performed to assess changes in the lung. CT findings were classified into two categories: pulmonary reaction and pleural reaction. A dose-volume histogram for each patient was calculated, using a three-dimensional CT planning system. Statistical analysis was conducted using Spearman's rank test. RESULTS: The median appearance period of pulmonary reactions was 3 months after the start of carbon ion irradiation, whereas the maximum period was 6 months. The severity of pulmonary reactions statistically correlated with lung volumes irradiated no less than 20 GyE (vol. 20) and 40 GyE (vol. 40) (p = 0.017 and p = 0.0089). Geometrically unique findings in the irradiated fields were observed in 7 patients (16%). The median appearance period of pleural reactions was 4 months after the start of carbon ion irradiation. The occurrence of pleural reactions significantly correlated with planning target volume (p = 0.000098), vol. 20 (p = 0.00011), and vol. 40 (p = 0.00097). CONCLUSIONS: Lung damage after carbon ion irradiation was observed in the parenchyma and in the pleura. The severity of pulmonary reactions was correlated with dose-volume factors. These findings might provide useful information in the planning and management of carbon ion irradiation

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1994 and 2002, 51 patients with intracranial meningiomas of the base of the skull were treated with a combination of photon and proton RT. Median total dose was 60.6 cobalt Gy equivalent (54-64). One hundred eight eye-related symptoms were collected; 80 other symptoms were noted and followed up. RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 25.4 months. Acute tolerance was excellent. Out of the 108 eye-related symptoms, 106 (96%) were evaluated. Improvements were reported for 73 (68.8%) of them. Out of the 88 other miscellaneous symptoms, 81 (92%) were evaluated. Improvements were reported in 54 cases (67%). Median time to improvement ranged from 1 to 24 months after completion of the radiotherapy, depending on the symptom. We did not observe any worsening of primary clinical signs. Radiologically, 1 patient relapsed 4 months after the end of irradiation. Pathology revealed a malignant (Grade 3) transformation of the initial Grade 1 meningioma. Four-year local control and overall survival rates were, respectively, 98% and 100%. Stabilization of the tumor was observed in 38 cases (72%), volume reduction in 10 cases (20%), and intratumor necrosis in 3 cases. Two patients complained of Grade 3 side effects: 1 unilateral hearing loss requiring aid and 1 case of complete pituitary deficiency. CONCLUSION: These results stressed the clinical efficacy of fractionated-associated photon-proton RT in the treatment of meningiomas, especially on cranial nerve palsies, without severe toxicity in almost all patients

METHODS: Nineteen patients with olfactory neuroblastoma (ONB) or neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) were treated between 1992 and 1998 on a prospective study. Four patients had Kadish Stage B disease, and 15 patients had Kadish Stage C disease. The median patient age was 44 years. Patients received chemotherapy with 2 courses of cisplatin and etoposide followed by high-dose proton-photon radiotherapy to 69.2 cobalt-Gray equivalents (CGE) using 1.6-1.8 CGE per fraction twice daily in a concomitant boost schedule. Two further courses of chemotherapy were given to responders. RESULTS: Of 19 patients, 15 patients were alive at the time of this report with a median follow-up of 45 months (range, 20-92 months). Four patients died from disseminated disease 8-47 months after their original diagnosis. The 5-year survival rate was 74%. There were two local recurrences, and both patients underwent salvage surgery. The 5-year local control rate of initial treatment was 88%. Acute toxicity of chemotherapy was tolerable, with no patient sustaining more than Grade 3 hematologic toxicity. Thirteen patients showed a partial or complete response to chemotherapy. One patient developed unilateral visual loss after the first course of chemotherapy; otherwise, visual preservation was achieved in all patients. Four patients who were clinically intact developed radiation-induced damage to the frontal or temporal lobe by magnetic resonance imaging criteria. Two patients showed soft tissue and/or bone necrosis, and one of these patients required surgical repair of a cerebrospinal fluid leak. CONCLUSIONS: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy and high-dose proton-photon radiotherapy is a successful treatment approach for patients with ONB and NEC. Radical surgery is reserved for nonresponders. Due to the precision of delivery of radiation with stereotactic setup and protons, no radiation-induced visual loss was observed

The localisation and locally-destructive growth require a multidisciplinary diagnostic and therapeutic concept early on. The goal of the present study was to present a reproducible strategy for quality assurance. PATIENTS AND METHOD: We retrospectively analysed the hospital records of 10 consecutive patients (4 women and 6 men) whom we had treated during a period of 7 years. RESULTS: The first step in therapy was tumour resection in 9 cases. One patient initially underwent stereotactic radiation. Postoperative radiation was not included a priori, but discussed individually depending on the degree of resection, the patient's age and physical condition. After an average 5 years follow up, 100 % of patients are alive. In all patients, tumour control was achieved. CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis for patients with chordomas of the skull base has improved considerably in recent years. New technologies like intraoperative navigation and improved radiation procedures have contributed to this improvement. The basis for treatment remains, however, the greatest possible surgical exstirpation with minimal surgical morbidity. Special attention should be paid in this connection to the stability of the cervical spine and the craniocervical transition border. In advanced tumour growth, complete resection is often not possible. Proton and heavy-ion radiation are promising new forms of therapy, which can also be applied after conventional radiation has been performed. A directed multidisciplinary procedure guarantees years of survival with good quality of life in many cases

Protons offer an opportunity to increase the radiation dose to the prostate while minimizing treatment toxicity. METHODS: Six hundred forty-three patients with localized prostate cancer were treated with protons, with or without photons. Treatments were planned with a 3D planning system; patients received 74-75 CGE (Cobalt Gray Equivalent) at 1.8-2.0 CGE per fraction. Patients were evaluated for response to therapy and treatment-related toxicity. RESULTS: The overall clinical disease-free survival rate was 89% at 5 years. When post-treatment prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was used as an endpoint for disease control, the 4.5-year disease-free survival rate was 100% for patients with an initial PSA of < 4.0 ng/ml, and 89%, 72%, and 53% for patients with initial PSA levels of 4.1-10.0, 10.1-20.0, and > 20.0, respectively. Patients in whom the post-treatment PSA nadir was below 0.5 ng/ml did significantly better than those whose nadir values were between 0.51-1.0 or > 1.0 ng/ml: the corresponding 5-year disease-free survival rates were 91%, 79%, and 40%, respectively. Minimal radiation proctitis was seen in 21% of patients; toxicity of greater severity was seen in less than 1%. CONCLUSION: Proton therapy to 74-75 CGE produced minimal treatment-related toxicity and excellent PSA normalization and disease-free survival in patients with low initial PSA levels. A prospective randomized dose-escalation trial is now underway to help define the optimum dose of radiation for patients with early stage prostate cancer

METHODS AND MATERIALS: We report 45 patients treated for chordoma or chondrosarcoma with postoperative fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy between 1990 and 1997. Patients had CT and MRI for 3D treatment planning performed under stereotactic guidance. Median dose at isocenter was 66.6 Gy for chordomas and 64.9 Gy for chondrosarcomas. MRI imaging was obtained in intervals after therapy to evaluate local relapse. Survival was calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: All chondrosarcomas had achieved and maintained local control and recurrence-free status at follow-up of 5 years. Local control rate of chordomas was 82% at 2 years and 50% at 5 years. Survival was 97% at 2 years and 82% at 5 years. At maximum follow-up of 8 years local control and survival rate of chordomas was 40% (82%). Clinically significant late toxicity developed in one patient. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate the feasibility of fractionated photon beam therapy and its success in the treatment of skull base tumors. Modern 3D treatment techniques provide superior results compared to conventional techniques. The role of high-precision radiotherapy compared to particle beam therapy in the treatment of these tumors is not yet fully clear and further research is needed

This precludes safe delivery of potentially curative high-dose fractionated proton radiotherapy. To avoid this problem, the authors performed pedicled rhinotomy to resect chordomas in 10 patients. METHODS: Pedicled rhinotomy is a midface transnasal route to the intercarotid sella and clivus from the tuberculum sellae to the mid-C-2 level. It involves a lateral rhinotomy incision, osteotomies of nasal bones and cartilage, lateral rotation of the nose, removal of the nasal septum and medial maxillary walls, opening of ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses, and dissection of nasopharynx and oropharynx to expose the clivus and craniovertebral junction. Tumors involving the sella, medial cavernous sinuses, middle and lower clivus, and C-1 arch and dens can be removed even if they traverse the dura. Closure involves dural repair, grafting of fat and split-thickness skin, rotation of a vascularized mucosal pedicle, and reattachment of nasal cartilage. Ten clival chordomas in adult patients were surgically removed via a pedicled rhinotomy approach. Seven patients had previously undergone a total of nine skull base procedures. In eight of the 10 patients, tumors compressing the brainstem were completely removed using this technique. One patient required an additional subtemporal resection of a suprasellar tumor before definitive radiotherapy could be undertaken. No patient sustained any new neurological deficit; in eight patients headache, diplopia, or hemiparesis improved. One patient developed postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leakage and meningitis that were successfully treated with antibiotic agents and shunt placement. CONCLUSIONS: Pedicled rhinotomy provides excellent shallow-field exposure of midline clival chordomas and permits relief of brainstem compression and the postoperative administration of potentially curative proton beam irradiation

METHODS: We retrospectively identified four patients who presented with uveal melanoma and rhegmatogenous retinal detachment simultaneously and six patients in whom a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment developed 11-100 months (mean, 44.8 months) after radiotherapy for a choroidal melanoma. RESULTS: All four patients with simultaneous presentation of uveal melanoma and retinal detachment underwent successful retinal detachment repair (cases 1 and 4, scleral buckle; case 2, pars plana vitrectomy, and case 3, pneumatic retinoplexy). Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment occurring after proton beam or plaque radiotherapy of uveal melanoma was repaired successfully in five of six patients with scleral buckling alone or in combination with pars plana vitrectomy. In the short follow-up period of this study, we did not observe tumor recurrence either before or after retinal detachment repair. CONCLUSION: Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment associated with uveal melanoma may be treated successfully using conventional retinal surgical techniques. The benefits of retinal detachment repair must be weighed against any theoretical increased risk of extra-scleral extension of the melanoma. Long-term follow-up evaluation will be required to determine the safety of various retinal detachment repair techniques in these eyes

METHODS: Four patients with unresectable solitary hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma underwent 55-82 Gy proton-beam irradiation for a period of 15-47 days. Follow-up CT including plain, enhanced and dynamic imaging was performed for a period of 9-36 months. RESULTS: Good preservation of arterial blood supply while gradual decrease in tumour size was clearly depicted by dynamic CT. CONCLUSION: We believe that preservation of hypervascularity as judged by enhancement at CT and magnetic resonance imaging, does not necessarily mean that radiotherapy in hypervascular malignant tumours has been unsuccessful

METHODS: Sixteen patients, aged 7-34 years, were treated with proton-beam radiation. All had undergone at least one tumor resection. Seven patients underwent repeat resection for recurrence; one had previous x-ray radiotherapy. A daily dose of 1.8 cobalt gray equivalent was used to give a total dose in the range of 50.4-59.4 cobalt gray equivalent. RESULTS: Local control was achieved in 14 of 15 patients. Twelve of 15 patients survived. There were few acute side effects. Long-term complications included newly diagnosed panhypopituitarism, a cerebrovascular accident from which the patient fully recovered, and an out-of-proton-field meningioma in the single patient who received previous radiotherapy. DISCUSSION: Fractionated proton radiotherapy is an effective treatment for children with craniopharyngioma. Longer follow-up is needed to evaluate late complications

METHODS: Two patients initially diagnosed and treated for unilateral scleritis were referred for management of persistent inflammation. Additional evaluation uncovered underlying malignant processes. RESULTS: The first patient presented with scleritis initially responsive to systemic corticosteroids, with relapse one month later. Upon referral, peripheral fundus examination revealed elevated lesions. Additional studies confirmed the diagnosis of choroidal melanoma. The patient was treated with proton-beam irradiation. The second patient developed necrotizing scleritis unresponsive to systemic steroids, methotrexate, and cyclophosphamide. A scleral biopsy disclosed an undifferentiated high-grade carcinoma, likely metastatic. Exenteration was performed. CONCLUSIONS: Scleritis can present a diagnostic challenge. It is often the sole initial manifestation of an occult systemic problem. Treatment-resistant scleritis should raise the suspicion of an infectious or malignant masquerade	
1	2512	Charged particle radiotherapy for lesions encircling the brain stem or spinal cord	Brain, Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Brain Stem, California, Californium, Chondrosarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Chordoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Immobilization, Incidence, Ions, Knowledge, Particle Accelerators, Prognosis, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/ae [Adverse Effects], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Research, Spinal Cord Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Uncertainty, Universities	Since 1981, a specialized technique has been under development at the University of California Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory for charged particle irradiation of tumors partially or completely encircling the brain stem or spinal cord. By dividing the target volume into two or more portions and using a combination of beams, a reasonably homogeneous irradiation of the target volume can be obtained which protects critical CNS structures from over-irradiation. This technique requires knowledge of the physical and biological effects of charged particles, precise, reproducible patient immobilization, careful treatment planning based upon Metrizamide contrast CT and/or MRI scanning, compensation for tissue inhomogeneities, and accurate, verifiable radiation delivery. Uncertainties in the dose distribution must be taken into account when prescribing treatment. We have used this technique in 47 patients with a variety of tumors abutting the brain stem and spinal cord, including chordoma, chondrosarcoma, meningioma, osteosarcoma and metastatic tumors. The results have shown a significant local control rate (62%) and the incidence of serious complications has been acceptable (13%). The median follow-up is 20 months with a range of 6-90 months. We conclude that charged particles can be safely and effectively used to irradiate lesions encircling the brain stem or spinal cord to doses higher than can be achieved with low-LET irradiation

Recently, both radical resection and charged-particle irradiation or stereotactic radiosurgery have reportedly been found effective for tumor control and for promoting a better quality of life in patients. In this article the authors analyzed the outcomes in 17 patients with skull base chordomas who were surgically treated at Kobe University Hospital between 1972 and 2000. METHODS: Preoperative radiological examinations included magnetic resonance imaging, computerized tomography, angiography, and balloon occlusion test of the internal carotid artery. Among the various surgical approaches used to remove the tumor were the frontoorbitozygomatic, transmaxillary, transcondylar, transsphenoidal, and the transbasal. Total removal was achieved in two (12%), near-total removal in three (18%), subtotal removal in nine (52%), and partial removal in three patients (18%). Since 1990, chordomas have been radically resected via various skull base approaches; the combined total or near-total removal rate has been 80% in this period. Radical removal of the tumors has not led to an increased risk. At the final follow-up review (mean 59.5 month), 75% of the patients were still alive, and 25% had died of chordoma recurrence. The overall recurrence-free survival rate was 82% at 3 years and 51% at 5 years. The 5-year recurrence-free survival rate in the five patients who underwent the operation during the past decade was 77% (mean follow up of 5.2 years). In two patients with recurrent tumors who underwent radiosurgery, no evidence of tumor regrowth was demonstrated at 3 years posttreatment. CONCLUSIONS: The authors suggest that for the treatment of skull base chordomas radical resection is a key factor for longer survival and improved quality of life. Patients with sufficiently small tumors, which show a favorable configuration and location, can be suitable candidates for stereotactic radiosurgery

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Ten patients were planned with both 3D-CPT (two parallel-opposed lateral fields) and IMRT (seven equally spaced coplanar fields). Prescribed dose was 79.2 Gy (or cobalt Gray-equivalent, [CGE] for protons) to the prostate gland. Dose-volume histograms, dose conformity, and equivalent uniform dose (EUD) were compared. Additionally, plans were optimized for 3D-CPT with nonstandard beam configuration, and for IMPT assuming delivery with beam scanning. RESULTS: At least 98% of the planning target volume received the prescription dose. IMRT plans yielded better dose conformity to the target, whereas proton plans achieved higher dose homogeneity and better sparing of rectum and bladder in the range below 30 Gy/CGE. Bladder volumes receiving more than 70 Gy/CGE (V70) were reduced, on average, by 34% with IMRT vs. 3D-CPT, whereas rectal V70 were equivalent. EUD from 3D-CPT and IMRT plans were indistinguishable within uncertainties for both bladder and rectum. With the use of small-angle lateral-oblique fields in 3D-CPT and IMPT, the rectal V70 was reduced by up to 35% compared with the standard lateral configuration, whereas the bladder V70 increased by less than 10%. CONCLUSIONS: In the range higher than 60 Gy/CGE, IMRT achieved significantly better sparing of the bladder, whereas rectal sparing was similar with 3D-CPT and IMRT. Dose to healthy tissues in the range lower than 50% of the target prescription was substantially lower with proton therapy

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-one patients aged > or =80 years with HCC underwent proton beam therapy. At the time of irradiation, patient age ranged from 80 to 85 years (median, 81 years). Hepatic tumors were solitary in 17 patients and multiple in 4. Tumor size ranged from 10 to 135 mm (median, 40 mm) in maximum diameter. Ten, 5, and 6 patients received proton beam irradiation with total doses of 60 Gy in 10 fractions, 66 Gy in 22 fractions, and 70 Gy in 35 fractions, respectively, according to tumor location. RESULTS: All irradiated tumors were controlled during the follow-up period of 6-49 months (median, 16 months). Five patients showed new hepatic tumors outside the irradiated volume, 2-13 months after treatment, and 1 of them also had lung metastasis. The local progression-free and disease-free rates were 100% and 72% at 3 years, respectively. Of 21 patients, 7 died 6-49 months after treatment; 2 patients each died of trauma and old age, and 1 patient each died of HCC, pneumonia, and arrhythmia. The 3-year overall, cause-specific, and disease-free survival rates were 62%, 88%, and 51%, respectively. No therapy-related toxicity of Grade > or = 3 but thrombocytopenia in 2 patients was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy seems to be tolerable, effective, and safe for aged patients with HCC. It may contribute to prolonged survival due to tumor control	
0	885	Reducing toxicity from craniospinal irradiation: using proton beams to treat medulloblastoma in young children	California, Cerebellar Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Child,Preschool, Cobalt, Cranial Irradiation/mt [Methods], Female, Humans, Lymphocyte Count, Medulloblastoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Pilot Projects, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Spinal Cord/re [Radiation Effects], Treatment Outcome, X-Rays	PURPOSE: We report on a radiation treatment technique that has reduced the dose to critical normal structures in children with medulloblastoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three children between the ages of 3 and 4 with stage M2 or M3 medulloblastoma were treated between 2001 and 2003 with craniospinal irradiation using protons. Patients received 36 cobalt gray equivalent to the craniospinal axis, then 18 cobalt gray equivalent to the posterior fossa. The cranium was treated with opposed lateral fields. The spine was treated with three matched posteroanterior fields, with the beam stopping just beyond the thecal sac. The posterior fossa was then treated with alternating posteroanterior, right posterior oblique, and left posterior oblique fields, with the beam stopping just proximal to the cochlea. The use of general anesthesia and pre-porting with diagnostic-quality x-rays allowed precise patient positioning. RESULTS: Craniospinal irradiation delivered via conformal proton irradiation substantially reduced the dose to the cochlea and vertebral bodies and virtually eliminated the exit dose through thorax, abdomen, and pelvis. Despite concurrent chemotherapy, a clinically significant lymphocyte count reduction was not seen. Patients tolerated treatment well; acute side effects (e.g., nausea, decreased appetite, and odynophagia) were mild. All patients completed therapy without interruption. CONCLUSION: Our proton-beam technique for craniospinal irradiation of pediatric medulloblastoma has successfully reduced normal-tissue doses and acute treatment-related sequelae. This technique may be especially advantageous in children with a history of myelosuppression, who might not other wise tolerate irradiation

Consequences of treatment are likely to affect the survivor's quality of life significantly. We investigated the feasibility of spot-scanning proton therapy (PT) for soft tissue tumors in childhood. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Sixteen children with soft tissue sarcomas were included. Median age at PT was 3.3 years. In 10 children the tumor histology was embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma. All tumors were located in the head or neck, parameningeal, or paraspinal, or pelvic region. In the majority of children, the tumor was initially unresectable (Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study [IRS] Group III in 75%). In 50% of children the tumors exceeded 5 cm. Fourteen children had chemotherapy before and during PT. Median total dose of radiotherapy was 50 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE). All 16 children were treated with spot-scanning proton therapy at the Paul Scherrer Institute, and in 3 children the PT was intensity-modulated (IMPT). RESULTS: After median follow-up of 1.5 years, local control was achieved in 12 children. Four children failed locally, 1 at the border of the radiation field and 3 within the field. All 4 children died of tumor recurrence. All 4 showed unfavorable characteristic either of site or histopathology of the tumor. Acute toxicity was low, with Grade 3 or 4 side effects according to Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (RTOG/EORTC) criteria occurring in the bone marrow only. CONCLUSIONS: Proton therapy was feasible and well tolerated. Early local control rates are comparable to those being achieved after conventional radiotherapy. For investigations on late effect, longer follow-up is needed

[Japanese]	Adult, Aged, Humans, Middle Aged, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Skin, Universities	It has been recognized that, for precise localization and verification of radiation fields, a marking drawn on the skin surface is not entirely reliable because its position relative to bony structures or internal organs is not stationary. This is especially true when treating deep-seated tumors located below the clavicle. In proton beam radiotherapy at the University of Tsukuba, we ristrict the margins around the target volume. Therefore, special care in field localization and verification is needed, and we make it a rule to take X-ray pictures on each treatment day. To accomplish this, we have developed a localize-and-verify system by using fluoroscopic techniques and combining it with a real-time digital image processing device. This allows for the formation of a digital image of the proton field and storage it in the optic disc. By using this system as well as verification films, filed placement errors were measured in 10 patients with deep-seated tumors. Out of a total of 190 localizations, 22% exhibited a field placement error of more than 5 mm, where patient positioning and field localization were done by using skin drawings aligned with laser beams. This result strongly suggests the necessity for daily localization and verification of radiation fields, as is being done by us, for precision in the execution of proton beam radiation therapy

A second set of lateral lasers was mounted approximately 20 cm below the isocentre allowing patient positioning at an ergonomical height. A small randomised study involving 16 heavy patients treated for pelvic malignancies demonstrated that using the lower lasers for patient set-up is not only likely to reduce strain on staff but also speed up the set-up process

METHODS: 54 patients after with malignant brain tumor (44 cases of glioblastoma, 10 other high-grade gliomas) were examined post-surgically in a total of 140 proton MRS examinations in the course of radiotherapy and in follow-up controls. Fast SI acquisition was performed as single-slice or double-slice TSI sequence with 32 x 32 phase encodings within 11 or 15 minutes, respectively. SVS with TR/TE 2000/272 ms yielded relative metabolite ratios, and in 15 patients the time courses of the absolute concentrations of brain metabolites were also determined. RESULTS: In the group of 44 patients that could be tracked by MRS until therapy completion, TSI localized in 23 patients a persistent or newly arisen distinct choline accumulation indicating residual or recurrent tumor after radiation therapy. In all these cases MRS diagnosis was confirmed histologically or by short-term follow-up. However, in 6 of 15 patients showing a normal choline pattern in the TSI acquisition, tumor recurrence appeared within three months. SVS provided early recognition of recurrent tumor when detecting characteristic alterations of metabolite concentrations oin therapy follow-up. CONCLUSION: TSI and SVS represent complementary MRS techniques and are able to diagnose tumor recurrence early and unambiguously in cases where focal choline accumulation is detected

It included irradiation of the bed of tumor removed. Fast electron beam was produced by a small betatron (collimator size--5 x 6 cm and 8 x 12 cm) installed in the operating room. Radiation was given to a single or to multiple fields in a single dose of 10-20 Gy to each field. Location of the radioactive source in the operating room proved technically, economically and medically advantageous since it was cheaper, assured a shorter period of the treatment and delivered from patient transportation to a radiotherapy department and ensuing complications. The procedure did not interfere with postoperative period. The efficacy of the treatment modality will be evaluated as soon as sufficient end results have been obtained

Eighty-two percent of the patients had widespread metastatic disease, and the mean tumor burden was 2,900 cc. Seventy-nine percent of the patients received concurrent radiotherapy. Acute toxicity consisted primarily of pain within the AA aperture (43%), systemic stress (43%), and nausea or vomiting (29%). Systemic stress was the most frequent power-limiting factor (46%). There were two treatment-related complications: sciatic neuritis from intramuscular injection (one) and pleural effusion from thermometry probe placement (one). Detailed thermal mapping and thermal dosimetry were performed on 26 patients. The mean thermal dosimetry parameters were quite low. Concurrent radiation doses were also quite low (mean, 1,500 rad) to avoid toxicity of sensitive organ systems within the abdomen. The objective response rate was only 18%, all partial, but 43% of the patients achieved effective symptomatic palliation. The five objective responders did survive significantly (P = .02) longer than the 23 nonresponders

[Review] [27 refs] [German]	Calibration, Carbon, Heavy Ions/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Ions, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods]	Since December 1997, patients are treated with carbon ions at GSI (Gesellschaft fur Schwerionenforschung). Dose delivery is performed with the intensity-controlled raster-scanning technique, which allows a highly conformal treatment of the tumor. To meet the special requirements of dosimetry with heavy ion beams, new dosimetric measurement techniques were developed and introduced into clinical application by the DKFZ (Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum). The techniques comprise calibration of the irradiation monitor, checks of lateral and depth dose profiles, as well as verification of the beam delivery for complex three-dimensional dose distributions. The developed dosimetric methods are now integral part of clinical application and enable safe treatment with carbon ion therapy. [References: 27]

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The organ equivalent dose (OED) concept with a linear-exponential, a plateau, and a linear dose-response curve was applied to dose distributions of 23 patients who received RT of prostate cancer. Conformal RT was used in 7 patients, 8 patients received IMRT with 6- and 15-MV photons, and 8 patients were treated with spot-scanned protons. We applied target doses ranging from 70 Gy to 100 Gy. Cancer risk was estimated as a function of target dose and tumor control probability. RESULTS: At a 100-Gy target dose the secondary cancer risk relative to the 3D treatment plan at 70 Gy was +18.4% (15.0% for a plateau model, 22.3% for a linear model) for the 6-MV IMRT plan, +25.3% (17.0%, 14.1%) for the 15-MV IMRT plan, and -40.7% (-41.3%, -40.0%) for the spot-scanned protons. The increasing risk of developing a radiation-associated malignancy after RT with increasing dose was balanced by the enhanced cure rates at a larger dose. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer risk after dose escalation for prostate RT is expected to be equal to or lower than for conventional 3D treatment at 70 Gy, independent of treatment modality or dose-response model. Spot-scanned protons are the treatment of choice for dose escalation because this therapy can halve the risk of secondary cancers

We review our experience of acoustic tumor treatments at one institution using a gamma knife for SRS and the first commercial world installation of a dedicated linac for SRT. METHODS: Patients were treated with SRS on the gamma knife or SRT on the linac from October 1994 through August 2000. Gamma knife technique involved a fixed-frame multiple shot/high conformality single treatment, whereas linac technique involved daily conventional fraction treatments involving a relocatable frame, fewer isocenters, and high conformality established by noncoplanar arc beam shaping and differential beam weighting. RESULTS: Sixty-nine patients were treated on the gamma knife, and 56 patients were treated on the linac, with 1 NF-2 patient common to both units. Three patients were lost to follow-up, and in the remaining 122 patients, mean follow-up was 119 +/- 67 weeks for SRS patients and 115 +/- 96 weeks for SRT patients. Tumor control rates were high (> or =97%) for sporadic tumors in both groups but lower for NF-2 tumors in the SRT group. Cranial nerve morbidities were comparably low in both groups, with the exception of functional hearing preservation, which was 2.5-fold higher in patients who received conventional fraction SRT. CONCLUSION: SRS and SRT represent comparable noninvasive treatments for acoustic schwannomas in both sporadic and NF-2 patient groups. At 1-year follow-up, a significantly higher rate of serviceable hearing preservation was achieved in SRT sporadic tumor patients and may therefore be preferable to alternatives including surgery, SRS, or possibly observation in patients with serviceable hearing

Eleven patients were initially treated with x-ray at doses of 16.2-50.4 (mean 42.5) Gy, followed by proton beam at doses of 30.0-52.9 (mean 37.6) Gy. The other four patients were treated with proton beams alone at total doses of 75.0-88.5 (mean 81.4) Gy. The mean total dose for the 15 patients was 80.4 Gy. As a result, the primary tumor lesions of all 15 patients disappeared and complete responses were obtained. Approximately four to five months later, nine of the 15 patients developed esophageal ulcer formations at the circumferences of their primary lesions. The ulcerations were healed, however, by conservative management. There was no evidence of local recurrence throughout the observations on six cases of superficial carcinoma. Among nine advanced carcinoma patients, three relapsed into esophageal carcinoma. Recurrences were observed eight, 16 and 44 months, respectively, after the treatment. Ten of the 15 patients died, but eight died of other diseases. Three of four cases at autopsy did not show any cancer cells in irradiated primary lesions. Four of the 15 patients lived for over five years. The results suggest that a high dose of irradiation delivered by a well-defined proton field could result in improved local control and long-term survival in esophageal carcinoma without undue risk of injury to primary and adjacent organs

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between December 1995 and December 1999, 17 patients received a treatment by 201-MeV proton beam at the Centre de Protontherapie d'Orsay (CPO) for a meningioma. Five patients presented a histologically atypical or malignant meningioma, twelve patients a benign one that was recurrent or rapidly progressive. In two cases radiotherapy was administered in the initial course of the disease and in 15 cases at the time of relapse. A highly conformal approach was used combining high-energy photons and protons for approximately 2/3 and 1/3 of the total dose. The median total dose delivered within gross tumor volume was 61 Cobalt Gray Equivalent CGE (25-69). RESULTS: Median follow-up was 37 months (17-60). The 4-year local control and overall survival rates were 87.5 +/- 12% and 88.9 +/- 11%, respectively. One patient failed locally within the clinical tumor volume. One patient died of intercurrent disease. A complete or partial clinical improvement was seen in most of patients. Radiologically, there were eleven stable diseases and five partial responses. In 12/15 recurrent cases, the free interval after radiotherapy is longer than that achieved by the initial surgery. This radiotherapy was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: In both benign and more aggressive meningiomas, the combination of conformal photons and protons with a dose escalated by 10-15% offers clinical improvements in most patients as well as radiological long-term stabilization

With its energy (62 MeV proton beam), it is ideal for the treatment of shallow tumors like those of the ocular region: uveal melanoma, first of all (the most common primary intraocular malignancy of adults) and other less frequent lesions like choroidal hemangioma, conjunctiva melanoma, and eyelid tumors. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The first patient was enrolled in February 2002, and to date 30 patients have been treated. All patients had a localized uveal melanoma, with no systemic metastases, and had specific indications for proton beam radiation therapy: lesions between 5-25 mm basal diameter, not exceeding 15 mm thickness, absence of total retinal detachment or glaucoma. According to the tumor dimensions, 2 patients had a small lesion or T1 (6%), 3 had a medium-sized lesion or T2 (10%), 14 had a large lesion or T3 (47%), and 11 had an extra-large lesion or T3 (37%); no patient had extrascleral invasion or T4 of the TNM-AJCC Staging System. In most cases, the tumor infiltrated only the choroid (14 patients, 47%) or the choroid plus the ciliary body (14 patients, 47%). We also treated a primitive iris melanoma, without diffusion to the ciliary body. The target volume was defined as the tumor plus a safety margin of 2.5 mm, laterally and antero-posteriorly; this margin was increased to 3 mm if ciliary body involvement was present. The treatment was carried out in 4 fractions on 4 consecutive days to a total dose of 54.5 Gy (single fraction 13.6 Gy), which corresponds to 60 CGE (Cobalt Gray Equivalent; single fraction 15 CGE), because the relative biological effectiveness is 1.1. RESULTS: The first follow-up is planned at 6-8 months after the end of the treatment, and our clinical end points are local control (defined as cessation of growth or tumor shrinkage), eye retention, and maintenance of a good visual function. At the time of this writing, we had preliminary results from 13 patients. Nine patients showed tumor shrinkage (69%), 3 a substantially stable dimension (23%), but almost all patients presented an increased ultrasound reflectivity (a surrogate for tumor control). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The literature data show that charged particle therapy has allowed an optimal local control in the treatment of uveal melanomas (about 96% in the different series, superior to that obtained with plaquetherapy [between 83% and 92%]), a metastatic rate slightly better than enucleation reports, and a survival rate of almost 90% at 5 years. Our preliminary results show a tumor response in almost all cases, with no major acute or subacute side effects. We thus plan to continue with our treatment procedures and our dose prescription

METHODS: We retrospectively identified four patients who presented with uveal melanoma and rhegmatogenous retinal detachment simultaneously and six patients in whom a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment developed 11-100 months (mean, 44.8 months) after radiotherapy for a choroidal melanoma. RESULTS: All four patients with simultaneous presentation of uveal melanoma and retinal detachment underwent successful retinal detachment repair (cases 1 and 4, scleral buckle; case 2, pars plana vitrectomy, and case 3, pneumatic retinoplexy). Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment occurring after proton beam or plaque radiotherapy of uveal melanoma was repaired successfully in five of six patients with scleral buckling alone or in combination with pars plana vitrectomy. In the short follow-up period of this study, we did not observe tumor recurrence either before or after retinal detachment repair. CONCLUSION: Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment associated with uveal melanoma may be treated successfully using conventional retinal surgical techniques. The benefits of retinal detachment repair must be weighed against any theoretical increased risk of extra-scleral extension of the melanoma. Long-term follow-up evaluation will be required to determine the safety of various retinal detachment repair techniques in these eyes

PATIENTS AND METHOD: Amifostine was given as daily intravenous application (500 mg) 10 to 15 minutes prior to radiotherapy in 20 patients. The results were compared with another collective of patients which was similar. RESULTS: According to the WHO score mucositis became manifest in 10 patients (Grade I) and 4 patients (Grade II) in the amifostine group vs 9 patients (Grade II), 6 patients (Grade III) and 1 patient (Grade IV) in the control group. Xerostomia has been seen in 15 patients (Grade I) and 5 patients (Grade II) after administration of amifostine. Without the drug 2 patients suffered from xerostomia (Grade I), 8 patients (Grade II) and 8 patients (Grade III), respectively. Administering amifostine had been feasible and non problematic. Only a small rate of toxic side effects like nausea (11%) or emesis (4%) was documented. CONCLUSIONS: Amifostine is an effective radioprotector decreasing acute and late side effects in patients with head and neck tumors	
1	4558	TPD-based evaluation of near threshold mono-energetic proton energies for the (7)Li(p,n)(7)Be production of neutrons for BNCT	Beryllium, Body Burden, Boron, Boron Neutron Capture Therapy/mt [Methods], Computer Simulation, Differential Threshold, Engineering, Humans, Japan, Linear Energy Transfer, Lithium, Models,Biological, Neutrons, Neutrons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Relative Biological Effectiveness, Research, Time, Universities	An evaluation of mono-energetic proton energies ranging from 1.885 MeV to 1.920 MeV was carried out to determine the viability of these near threshold energies in producing neutrons for BNCT via the (7)Li(p,n)(7)Be reaction. Neutron fields generated at these proton energies were assessed using the treatable protocol depth (TPD) and the maximum TPD (TPD(max)) as evaluation indices. The heavy charged particle (HCP) dose rate to tumour was likewise applied as a figure of merit in order to account for irradiation time and required proton current. Incident proton energies closer to the reaction threshold generated deeper TPDs compared to higher energy protons when no boron dose enhancers (BDE) were placed in the irradiation field. Introducing a BDE resulted in improved TPDs for high proton energies but their achievable TPD(max) were comparatively lower than that obtained for lower proton energies. In terms of the HCP dose rate to tumour, higher proton energies generated neutron fields that yielded higher dose rates both at TPD(max) and at fixed depths of comparison. This infers that higher currents are required to deliver the prescribed treatment dose to tumours for proton beams with energies closer to the (7)Li(p,n)(7)Be reaction threshold and more achievable proton currents of around 10 mA or less for proton energies from 1.900 MeV and above. The dependence on incident proton energy of the TPD, TPD(max) and the HCP dose rate to tumour with respect to the (10)B concentration in tumour and healthy tissues were also clarified in this study. Increasing the (10)B concentration in tumour while maintaining a constant T/N ratio resulted in deeper TPD(max) where a greater change in TPD(max) was obtained for proton energies closer to the (7)Li(p,n)(7)Be reaction threshold. The HCP dose rates to tumour for all proton energies also went up, with the higher proton energies benefiting more from the increased (10)B concentration	
1	837	The role of radiotherapy in the treatment of malignant salivary gland tumors	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Child, Female, Head, Humans, Linear Energy Transfer, Lymphatic Irradiation, Male, Middle Aged, Netherlands, Palliative Care, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Risk, Salivary Gland Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Salivary Gland Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Statistics as Topic	PURPOSE: We analyzed the role of primary and postoperative low linear energy transfer radiotherapy in 538 patients treated for salivary gland cancer in centers of the Dutch Head and Neck Oncology Cooperative Group, in search for prognostic factors and dose response. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The tumor was located in the parotid gland in 59%, submandibular gland in 14%, oral cavity in 23%, and elsewhere in 5%. In 386 of 498 patients surgery was combined with radiotherapy, with a median dose of 62 Gy. Median delay between surgery and radiotherapy was 6 weeks. In the postoperative radiotherapy group, adverse prognostic factors prevailed. Elective radiotherapy to the neck was given in 40%, with a median dose of 50 Gy. Primary radiotherapy (n = 40) was given for unresectable disease or M(1), with a dose range of 28-74 Gy. RESULTS: Postoperative radiotherapy improved 10-year local control significantly compared with surgery alone in T(3-4) tumors (84% vs. 18%), in patients with close (95% vs. 55%) and incomplete resection (82% vs. 44%), in bone invasion (86% vs. 54%), and perineural invasion (88% vs. 60%). Local control was not correlated with interval between surgery and radiotherapy. No dose-response relationship was shown. Postoperative radiotherapy significantly improved regional control in the pN(+) neck (86% vs. 62% for surgery alone). A rating scale for different sites, T stage, and histologic type may be applied to calculate the risk of disease in the neck at presentation, and so indicate the need for elective neck treatment. A marginal dose-response was seen, in favor of a dose > or =46 Gy. A clear dose-response relationship was shown for patients treated with primary radiotherapy. Five-year local control was 50% with a dose of 66-70 Gy. CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative radiotherapy with a dose of at least 60 Gy is indicated for patients with T(3-4) tumors, incomplete or close resection, bone invasion, perineural invasion, and pN(+). In unresectable tumors, a dose of at least 66 Gy is advisable

Results of a prospective study incorporating chemotherapy, surgery, and combined proton-photon radiotherapy	Adult, Aged, Boston, Cisplatin/ad [Administration & Dosage], Combined Modality Therapy, Drug Therapy,Combination, Etoposide/ad [Administration & Dosage], Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Massachusetts, Middle Aged, Necrosis, Neuroendocrine Tumors/th [Therapy], Nose Neoplasms/th [Therapy], Otorhinolaryngologic Surgical Procedures, Paranasal Sinus Neoplasms/th [Therapy], Prognosis, Prospective Studies, Protons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Recurrence, Research, Salvage Therapy, Survival, Survival Rate, Time	BACKGROUND: The authors report the results of a prospective study of patients with malignant neuroendocrine tumors of the sinonasal tract who received multimodality treatment incorporating high-dose proton-photon radiotherapy. METHODS: Nineteen patients with olfactory neuroblastoma (ONB) or neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) were treated between 1992 and 1998 on a prospective study. Four patients had Kadish Stage B disease, and 15 patients had Kadish Stage C disease. The median patient age was 44 years. Patients received chemotherapy with 2 courses of cisplatin and etoposide followed by high-dose proton-photon radiotherapy to 69.2 cobalt-Gray equivalents (CGE) using 1.6-1.8 CGE per fraction twice daily in a concomitant boost schedule. Two further courses of chemotherapy were given to responders. RESULTS: Of 19 patients, 15 patients were alive at the time of this report with a median follow-up of 45 months (range, 20-92 months). Four patients died from disseminated disease 8-47 months after their original diagnosis. The 5-year survival rate was 74%. There were two local recurrences, and both patients underwent salvage surgery. The 5-year local control rate of initial treatment was 88%. Acute toxicity of chemotherapy was tolerable, with no patient sustaining more than Grade 3 hematologic toxicity. Thirteen patients showed a partial or complete response to chemotherapy. One patient developed unilateral visual loss after the first course of chemotherapy; otherwise, visual preservation was achieved in all patients. Four patients who were clinically intact developed radiation-induced damage to the frontal or temporal lobe by magnetic resonance imaging criteria. Two patients showed soft tissue and/or bone necrosis, and one of these patients required surgical repair of a cerebrospinal fluid leak. CONCLUSIONS: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy and high-dose proton-photon radiotherapy is a successful treatment approach for patients with ONB and NEC. Radical surgery is reserved for nonresponders. Due to the precision of delivery of radiation with stereotactic setup and protons, no radiation-induced visual loss was observed

Because of their deep location, local infiltrative nature, and involvement of surrounding bone, treatment of chordomas is a challenge. In this study the authors analyze the data and prognostic factors obtained during the follow-up period (range 1-150 months, median 38 months) in 53 patients with craniocervical junction chordomas and 10 patients with chondrosarcomas. METHODS: Several surgical approaches were used, and some tumor excisions required staged procedures. Survival was calculated according the Kaplan-Meier method. Statistical analysis was performed using Fisher exact, log rank and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Radical/subtotal resection was achieved in 77.8% of the patients. The mortality rate during the follow-up period was 14.3%. In patients harboring chondrosarcoma better 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates were demonstrated than in those with chordoma (100% and 50.7%. respectively). Histological patterns (typical or chondroid chordomas) and patient age at onset of symptoms had no effect on the RFS rates. Radical/subtotal resections were associated with better RFS rates than partial resection. Adjuvant proton-beam therapy was shown to increase the RFS rates compared with conventional radiotherapy (90.9% and 19.4%, respectively, at 4 years posttreatment). Karyotypically abnormal tumors were associated with the worst RFS rates compared with karyotypically normal lesions (44.5% and 90.3%, respectively, at 3 years). Cases of cranial nerve palsy followed by those with cerebrospinal fluid leakages were the most frequent postoperative complications. Permanent postoperative neurological deficit was observed in 28.6% of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: A better prognosis was observed in patients with chondrosarcoma compared with those harboring chordoma. Histological pattern and patient age at symptom onset were not factors that influenced prognosis in cases of chordoma. Extensive resection and possibly adjuvant proton-beam therapy provided better prognoses for these patients	
1	2111	Analysis of head motion prior to and during proton beam therapy	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Dental Equipment, Efficiency, Female, Head, Head and Neck Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Immobilization, Male, Middle Aged, Monitoring,Physiologic/is [Instrumentation], Motion, Movement, Patient Satisfaction, Physics, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Signal Processing,Computer-Assisted, Universities	PURPOSE: We report on the use of a noninvasive patient motion monitoring system to evaluate the amount of head motion prior to and during proton radiation therapy sessions. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Two optical displacement sensors, placed close to the patient's head, were used for online monitoring of the head position, with submillimeter accuracy. Motion data, including the difference between start and end position (Dx) and the maximum displacement during the recorded session (Dx-max), were acquired for pretreatment sessions to analyze alignment radiographs, and for treatment sessions. We have recorded 102 pretreatment and 99 treatment sessions in 16 patients immobilized with a thermoplastic mask, and 44 pretreatment and 56 treatment sessions in 13 patients immobilized with vacuum-assisted dental fixation. To avoid incorrect data analysis due to replicate observations, only 1 pretreatment and 1 treatment session per patient were selected at random for statistical comparison of mean or median motion parameters in different subgroups. RESULTS: Both techniques showed similar immobilization efficiencies. The median Dx and Dx-max values were 0. 18 mm and 0.46 mm, respectively, for 16 treatment sessions with mask immobilization, and 0.22 mm and 0.50 mm, respectively, for 13 treatment sessions with dental immobilization. Motion parameters for pretreatment and treatment sessions were not statistically different. CONCLUSION: Online verification of patient's head motion is feasible and provides valuable data for confirmation of proper treatment delivery in individual patients, as well as for the evaluation of different immobilization methods	
1	1540	Radiotherapy for chordomas and low-grade chondrosarcomas of the skull base with carbon ions	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Carbon, Carbon Radioisotopes, Carbon Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Chondrosarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Chordoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Follow-Up Studies, Germany, Humans, Ions, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Middle Aged, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radioisotopes, Radiotherapy, Recurrence, Safety, Skull Base Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Stereotaxic Techniques, Survival	PURPOSE: Compared to photon irradiation, carbon ions provide physical and biologic advantages that may be exploited in chordomas and chondrosarcomas. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between August 1998 and December 2000, 37 patients with chordomas (n = 24) and chondrosarcomas (n = 13) were treated with carbon ion radiotherapy within a Phase I/II trial. Tumor conformal application of carbon ion beams was realized by intensity-controlled raster scanning with pulse-to-pulse energy variation. Three-dimensional treatment planning included biologic plan optimization. The median tumor dose was 60 GyE (GyE = Gy x relative biologic effectiveness). RESULTS: The mean follow-up was 13 months. The local control rate after 1 and 2 years was 96% and 90%, respectively. We observed 2 recurrences outside the gross tumor volume in patients with chordomas. Progression-free survival was 100% for chondrosarcomas and 83% for chordomas at 2 years. Partial remission after carbon ion radiotherapy was observed in 6 patients. Treatment toxicity was mild. CONCLUSION: These are the first data demonstrating the clinical feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of scanning beam delivery of ion beams in patients with skull base tumors. The preliminary results in patients with skull base chordomas and low-grade chondrosarcomas are encouraging, although the follow-up was too short to draw definite conclusions concerning outcome. In the absence of major toxicity, dose escalation might be considered

METHODS: Twenty males and 6 females were submitted to external beam therapy with 4-6 MV X-rays and received 60-70 Gy in fractions of 180 cGY to 200 cGy per day, 5 days a week. Radiation therapy technique was two posterior oblique portals and a single anterior field at 100 cm SAD. After 4500 cGy portals were coned down, holding the spinal cord dose below 4500 cGy. RESULTS: Global response to therapy was 73.1%. Median survival was 11 months. The 2-year survival rate was 12.5% in patients with lesions smaller than 5 cm and 5.5% for those with lesions greater than 5 cm. Patients with grade 2 dysphagia had a median survival of 16 months, those with grade 1, 11 months and 2 patients with grade 0, 4 and 9 months. In all patients mild to moderate esophagitis was observed. Two patients developed esophagotracheal fistula. CONCLUSIONS: Exclusively radiotherapy cannot be considered the treatment of choice in III stage patients. Primary chemoradiotherapy may emerge as the treatment of choice for cancer of the esophagus	
1	2643	Anterior segment sparing to reduce charged particle radiotherapy complications in uveal melanoma	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Analysis of Variance, Anterior Eye Segment, California, Californium, Eye, Eye Enucleation, Female, Glaucoma,Neovascular/et [Etiology], Helium, Helium/ae [Adverse Effects], Helium/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Male, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Methods, Middle Aged, Multivariate Analysis, Probability, Protons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Research, Risk, Risk Factors, Universities, Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	PURPOSE: The purpose of this investigation is to delineate the risk factors in the development of neovascular glaucoma (NVG) after helium-ion irradiation of uveal melanoma patients and to propose treatment technique that may reduce this risk. METHODS AND MATERIALS: 347 uveal melanoma patients were treated with helium-ions using a single-port treatment technique. Using univariate and multivariate statistics, the NVG complication rate was analyzed according to the percent of anterior chamber in the radiation field, tumor size, tumor location, sex, age, dose, and other risk factors. Several University of California San Francisco-Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) patients in each size category (medium, large, and extralarge) were retrospectively replanned using two ports instead of a single port. By using appropriate polar and azimuthal gaze angles or by treating patients with two ports, the maximum dose to the anterior segment of the eye can often be reduced. Although a larger volume of anterior chamber may receive a lower dose by using two ports than a single port treatment. We hypothesize that this could reduce the level of complications that result from the irradiation of the anterior chamber of the eye. Dose-volume histograms were calculated for the lens, and compared for the single and two-port techniques. RESULTS: NVG developed in 121 (35%) patients. The risk of NVG peaked between 1 and 2.5 years posttreatment. By univariate and multivariate analysis, the percent of lens in the field was strongly correlated with the development of NVG. Other contributing factors were tumor height, history of diabetes, and vitreous hemorrhage. Dose-volume histogram analysis of single-port vs. two-port techniques demonstrate that for some patients in the medium and large category tumor groups, a significant decrease in dose to the structures in the anterior segment of the eye could have been achieved with the use of two ports. CONCLUSION: The development of NVG after helium-ion irradiation is correlated to the amount of lens, anterior chamber in the treatment field, tumor height, proximity to the fovea, history of diabetes, and the development of vitreous hemorrhage. Although the influence of the higher LET deposition of helium-ions is unclear, this study suggests that by reducing the dose to the anterior segment of the eye may reduce the NVG complications. Based on this retrospective analysis of LBNL patients, we have implemented techniques to reduce the amount of the anterior segment receiving a high dose in our new series of patients treated with protons using the cyclotron at the UC Davis Crocker Nuclear Laboratory (CNL)

Thirty-six of 30 patients either remained stable or demonstrated tumor shrinkage. Seventeen of 18 patients followed up for at least one year after therapy demonstrated tumor regression, with a mean tumor shrinkage of approximately 40%. The most effective method of choroidal melanoma management is unclear. Charged-particle external-beam irradiation may be more applicable and have less ocular morbidity than either radioactive plaques or photocoagulation

Proton beam radiotherapy was applied to the lesion, since surgery was contraindicated. The total dose to the stomach lesion was 61 Gy in 7 wk. The tumor on the stomach regressed, with flattening of the round wall of the lesion. The reactive changes of the proton beam radiotherapy, based on the histopathological examination, revealed extensive tumor necrosis and sparing of vital architecture of normal tissue around the irradiated tumor tissue. Only small clusters of vital or devitalized tumor cells with less than approximately 5% of the whole tumor tissue remained after treatment. We suggest that a high dose of radiation delivered by well-defined proton field could result in an improved therapeutic outcome without undue risk of injury to normal tissue

We report the results in terms of local control, toxicity, and survival. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty patients with Grade 2/4 (n = 7) and Grade 3/4 (n = 13) gliomas according to the Daumas-Duport classification were treated on a prospective institutional protocol at Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory between 1993 and 1996. Doses prescribed to the target volumes were 68.2 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE, 1 proton Gray = 1.1 CGE) to gross tumor in Grade 2 lesions and 79.7 CGE in Grade 3 lesions. Fractionation was conventional, with 1.8 to 1.92 CGE once per day. Eligibility criteria included age between 18 and 70 years, biopsy-proven Daumas-Duport Grade 2/4 or 3/4 malignant glioma, Karnofsky performance score of 70 or greater, and supratentorial tumor. Median age of the patient population at diagnosis was 35.9 years (range 19-49). Ten tumors were mixed gliomas, one an oligodendroglioma. RESULTS: Five patients underwent biopsy, 12 a subtotal resection, and 3 a gross total resection. Median interval from surgery to first radiation treatment was 2.9 months. Actuarial 5-year survival rate for Grade 2 lesions was 71% as calculated from diagnosis (median survival not yet reached); actuarial 5-year survival for Grade 3 lesions was 23% (median 29 months). Median follow-up is 61 months and 55 months for 4 patients alive with Grade 2 and 3 patients alive with Grade 3 lesions, respectively. Three patients with Grade 2 lesions died from tumor recurrence, whereas 2 of the 4 survivors have evidence of radiation necrosis. Eight of 10 patients who have died with Grade 3 lesions died from tumor recurrence, 1 from pulmonary embolus, and 1 most likely from radiation necrosis. One of 3 survivors in this group has evidence of radiation necrosis. CONCLUSION: Tumor recurrence was neither prevented nor noticeably delayed in our patients relative to published series on photon irradiation. Dose escalation using this fractionation scheme and total dose delivered failed to improve outcome for patients with Grade 2 and 3 gliomas	
0	719	Endoscopic power-assisted orbital exenteration	Adult, Carcinoma,Squamous Cell/su [Surgery], Cavernous Sinus, Child, Endoscopy/mt [Methods], Eyelids/su [Surgery], Female, Head, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Mucormycosis/su [Surgery], Nerve Sheath Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Orbit Evisceration/mt [Methods], Paranasal Sinus Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Retrospective Studies, Sinusitis/mi [Microbiology], Sinusitis/su [Surgery], Time, Time Factors, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Wound Healing	BACKGROUND: Orbital exenteration can be accomplished by either an external eyelid-sparing or eyelid-sacrificing approach. The purpose of this study was to describe an alternative technique for orbital exenteration and its specific advantages over traditional methods. METHODS: A retrospective analysis at a tertiary care referral center was performed. Three patients with sinonasal malignancy (two cases) and fulminant invasive fungal sinusitis (one case) are reported. Intraconal involvement was evident in all patients by imaging and surgical pathology. Advanced endoscopic techniques in conjunction with image guidance and soft-tissue shaver technology were used for resection in all cases. RESULTS: The orbit was successfully exenterated via an eyelid-sparing endoscopic approach with minimal blood loss in all three patients. Exenteration was completed within 30-45 minutes. Uninvolved superior and lateral orbital periosteum was preserved in all patients, which permitted cavity "mucosalization" within 8 weeks. Two patients are alive without disease at 15-month follow-up. One patient with persistent cavernous sinus malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor died 4 months after resection despite proton beam therapy. CONCLUSION: This preliminary experience showed endoscopic power-assisted orbital exenteration to be an effective technique for exenteration of the orbit. Endoscopic power-assisted orbital exenteration offers two critical advantages: (1) direct transnasal control of the ophthalmic artery as it emerges from the optic foramen and (2) the ability to preserve the uninvolved superior and lateral periorbita. This can facilitate mucosal coverage of the exenterated space and obviate the need for tissue grafts and/or packing. Additionally, intraorbital pathology can be better visualized and blood loss and operative time are minimized. This technique may serve as an important adjunct for management of the orbit in patients with sinonasal malignancy or invasive fungal rhinosinusitis

One day after the completion of therapy, the patient developed nausea, vomiting, headache, and postural hypotension. Laboratory evaluation demonstrated a marked fall of the previously elevated urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroids (17-OHCS) and undetectable plasma cortisols. The urinary 17-OHCS transiently returned to supranormal levels but over a 2 1/2-week period decreased and then remained low. The patient also demonstrated a subnormal urinary aldosterone excretion in relation to plasma renin activity (PRA) during 10 mEq/24 h sodium restriction. The remainder of the endocrine evaluation was normal, suggesting that pituitary function otherwise remained intact. One and one-half years after alpha-particle therapy, the patients's urinary 17-OHCS were normal and responded normally to metyrapone. The relationship between urinary aldosterone excretion and PRA also was normal. It is postulated that there was an infarction of an ACTH secreting pituitary tumor leaving the remainder of the pituitary intact. Achronically elevated circulating level of ACTH with sudden loss of ACTH secretion appeared to have been responsible for the initial low urinary aldosterone as well as the low urinary 17-OHCS. This is the first reported case of a presumed pituitary tumor infarction in association with alpha-particle pituitary radiation

However, conventional photon-radiation treatment, as part of multimodality therapy, results in varying degrees of long-term functional and cosmetic side effects. This report introduces external beam proton radiation therapy (PRT) as a conformal, three-dimensional planned radiation technique for this disease, analyzes normal tissue dosimetry, and describes the technique's application in the first 2 patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between January 1995 and February 1996, 2 patients underwent PRT following biopsy and chemotherapy for orbital rhabdomyosarcoma. Fifty and 55 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE) were delivered to the gross tumor volume and 40 CGE to clinical target volumes in both patients. A relative biologic effectiveness (RBE) of 1.1 was utilized to correlate proton dose calculations with CGE. To achieve dose conformity, a "patch technique" was utilized, where target regions were divided into segments, each treated by a separate proton field. Dose-volume histograms were obtained for target and nontarget regions, including lens, bony orbit, pituitary gland, optic chiasm, optic nerves, lacrimal gland, and ipsilateral frontal and temporal lobes. RESULTS: At 3.4 and 2.5 years after PRT, both patients are clinically and radiographically free of disease. Visual acuity remains excellent, without signs of cataract formation; pituitary function is normal; cosmetically, only mild enophthalmos is noticeable. Doses to 90%, 50%, and 5% of lens volume were kept at less than 1%, less than 2%, and less than 8%, respectively. Fifty percent of lacrimal gland volume received less than 36% of the prescribed dose and 50% of the volume of the optic chiasm, pituitary gland, and hypothalamus were restricted to less than 2%. Proton conformity to orbital contents resulted in between 9% and 36% of the prescribed dose reaching the ipsilateral temporal and frontal lobes immediately adjacent to bony orbit (5% volume). CONCLUSION: PRT can offer excellent sparing of lens and selected intraorbital and ocular normal structures, while maintaining conformal target-dose coverage. The steep dose gradient beyond the orbit minimizes irradiation of normal brain parenchyma, with almost complete sparing of the pituitary gland. Reduction of integral irradiation exposure of the periorbital region will, hopefully, reduce the risk of second malignancy later in life. Reduced radiation dose to specific organs in close proximity to, but not part of the target region promises improved functional outcome and better cosmesis for childhood cancer survivors

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between November 1998 and September 2005, 54 patients with low-grade and intermediate-grade chondrosarcomas of the skull base have been treated with carbon ion radiation therapy (RT) using the raster scan technique at the Gesellschaft fur Schwerionenforschung in Darmstadt, Germany. All patients had gross residual tumors after surgery. Median total dose was 60 CGE (weekly fractionation 7 x 3.0 CGE). All patients were followed prospectively in regular intervals after treatment. Local control and overall survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Toxicity was assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria (CTCAE v.3.0) and the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG)/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) score. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 33 months (range, 3-84 months). Only 2 patients developed local recurrences. The actuarial local control rates were 96.2% and 89.8% at 3 and 4 years; overall survival was 98.2%at 5 years. Only 1 patient developed a mucositis CTCAE Grade 3; the remaining patients did not develop any acute toxicities >CTCAE Grade 2. Five patients developed minor late toxicities (RTOG/EORTC Grades 1-2), including bilateral cataract (n = 1), sensory hearing loss (n = 1), a reduction of growth hormone (n = 1), and asymptomatic radiation-induced white matter changes of the adjacent temporal lobe (n = 2). Grade 3 late toxicity occurred in 1 patient (1.9%) only. CONCLUSIONS: Carbon ion RT is an effective treatment for low- and intermediate-grade chondrosarcomas of the skull base offering high local control rates with low toxicity	
1	1509	Association of rectal toxicity with thermal dose parameters in treatment of locally advanced prostate cancer with radiation and hyperthermia	Boston, Confidence Intervals, Digestive System/pa [Pathology], Digestive System/re [Radiation Effects], Heat, Humans, Hyperthermia,Induced, Male, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Prostatic Neoplasms/th [Therapy], Protons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy,Conformal, Rectum/pa [Pathology], Rectum/re [Radiation Effects], Research, Temperature, Time Factors	PURPOSE: Although hyperthermia has been used for more than two decades in the treatment of pelvic tumors, little is known about the potential impact of heat on rectal toxicity when combined with other treatment modalities. Because rectal toxicity is a concern with radiation and may be exacerbated by hyperthermia, definition of the association of thermal dose parameters with rectal toxicity is important. In this report, we correlate rectal toxicity with thermal dose parameters for patients treated with hyperthermia and radiation for prostate cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty patients with T2b-T3b disease (1992 American Joint Committee On Cancer criteria) enrolled in a Phase II study of external beam radiation +/- androgen-suppressive therapy with two transrectal ultrasound hyperthermia treatments were assessed for rectal toxicity. Prostatic and anterior rectal wall temperatures were monitored for all treatments. Rectal wall temperatures were limited to 40 degrees C in 19 patients, 41 degrees C in 3 patients, and 42 degrees C in 8 patients. Logistic regression was used to estimate the log hazard of developing National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria Grade 2 toxicity based on temperature parameters. The following were calculated: hazard ratios, 95% confidence intervals, p values for statistical significance of each parameter, and proportion of variability explained for each parameter. RESULTS: Gastrointestinal toxicity was limited to Grade 2. The rate of acute Grade 2 proctitis was greater for patients with an allowable rectal wall temperature of >40 degrees C. In this group, 7 of 11 patients experienced acute Grade 2 proctitis, as opposed to 3 of 19 patients in the group with rectal wall temperatures limited to 40 degrees C (p = 0.004). Preliminary assessment of long-term toxicity revealed no differences in toxicity. Hazard ratios for acute Grade 2 proctitis for allowable rectal wall temperature, average rectal wall Tmax, and average prostate Tmax were 9.33 (p = 0.01), 3.66 (p = 0.03), and 2.29 (p = 0.08), respectively. A model combining these three parameters explained 48.6% of the variability among groups. CONCLUSION: Rectal toxicity correlates with maximum allowable rectal wall temperature, average rectal wall Tmax, and average prostate Tmax for patients undergoing transrectal ultrasound hyperthermia combined with radiation for treatment of advanced clinically localized prostate cancer. Further definition of this association of thermal dose parameters with rectal toxicity in treatment of pelvic malignancies with hyperthermia should advance the goal of delivering thermal therapy in an effective yet safe manner

Having two treatment ion beams(proton and carbon) and five treatment rooms, it is a pioneer among particle institutes worldwide. In May 2001, proton therapy was started as a clinical study for patients with localized cancer originating in the head and neck, lung, liver, and prostate. The aim of this study was to investigate the safety, effectiveness, and stability of the treatment units and systems based on the evaluation of acute toxicity, tumor response, and working ratio of the machine, respectively. Six patients, including liver cancer in three, prostate cancer in two, and lung cancer in one, were treated. There was no cessation of therapy owing to machine malfunction. Full courses of proton therapy consisting of 154 portals in all six patients were given exactly as scheduled. None of the patients experienced severe acute reactions of more than grade 3 according to NCI-CTC criteria. Tumor response one month post-treatment was evaluable in five of the six patients, and was CR in 1 (prostate cancer), PR in 2 (lung cancer: 1, liver cancer: 1), and NC in 2(liver cancer: 2). These results indicate that our treatment units and systems are safe and reliable enough for proton irradiation to be used for several malignant tumors localized in the body

We compared the actual (clinical) response with the predicted response estimated using our past experimental and clinical data, and discussed some problems to be overcome in the future. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We adopted an intravenous drip infusion of the compound whereby 170 mg/kg of the drug was administered over 4-5 hours before neutron irradiation. The patient was then irradiated with thermal neutrons from the Musashi Reactor at a reactor power of 100 kW and a neutron flux of 1.0 x 10(9) n/cm2/s at the collimator surface. The total absorbed dose to the melanoma and the surrounding skin was calculated by multiplying the thermal neutron fluences by the conversion factor. RESULTS: The total absorbed doses to the melanoma and the surrounding normal skin were calculated as 19.0 and 9.4 Gy, respectively. These absorbed doses were estimated at 33.5 and 14.2 RBE-Gy, respectively, assuming that the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of the high LET radiations was 2.0 and that each component of the mixed radiation was simply additive. The melanoma showed marked regression with mild skin reaction (dry desquamation) a month after therapy, and finally disappeared 10 months after therapy. There were no no substantial side effects. CONCLUSION: We concluded that the outcome of our calculated dose values agreed well with the clinical response and that their compatibility indicated considerable validity for our approach. However, there are still some problems-uncertainty concerning the 10B concentration in tumor and skin, determination of the total absorbed dose, and a single curative dose for malignant melanoma-to be overcome with regard to clinical use of this therapy

Although they do not usually show cytological atypia, metastases have been reported in 30 per cent of cases. Survival rates in cases of skull base locations are low, and local recurrence is common after local excision. Radiation therapy is used in post-operative treatment and proton radiation therapy as the primary treatment. In the present paper we present the case of a 50-year-old Caucasian man affected by chordoma of the clivus, with liver and chest metastases, relapsed after several surgical local excisions, to discuss improvements in therapeutic and imaging techniques. Indium111 (In111) pentetreotide single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was employed to assess the presence of somatostatin receptors and to treat the tumour with radiolabelled Y90-DOTA-lanreotide. Imaging, performed 2 months afterwards, showed stable disease in the lungs but a local progression in the metastases, in comparison with pre-treatment uptake. These data suggest the usefulness of radiolabelled somatostatin analogues in the diagnosis and therapy of chordomas	
1	4555	Monte Carlo simulation of neutron irradiation facility developed for accelerator based in vivo neutron activation measurements in human hand bones	Aluminum, Aluminum/an [Analysis], Canada, Computer Simulation, Filtration, Hand, Hand Bones/ch [Chemistry], Humans, Manganese/an [Analysis], Monte Carlo Method, Neutrons, Particle Accelerators, Physics, Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Radiation Protection, Research, Science, Universities	The neutron irradiation facility developed at the McMaster University 3 MV Van de Graaff accelerator was employed to assess in vivo elemental content of aluminum and manganese in human hands. These measurements were carried out to monitor the long-term exposure of these potentially toxic trace elements through hand bone levels. The dose equivalent delivered to a patient during irradiation procedure is the limiting factor for IVNAA measurements. This article describes a method to estimate the average radiation dose equivalent delivered to the patient's hand during irradiation. The computational method described in this work augments the dose measurements carried out earlier [Arnold et al., 2002. Med. Phys. 29(11), 2718-2724]. This method employs the Monte Carlo simulation of hand irradiation facility using MCNP4B. Based on the estimated dose equivalents received by the patient hand, the proposed irradiation procedure for the IVNAA measurement of manganese in human hands [Arnold et al., 2002. Med. Phys. 29(11), 2718-2724] with normal (1 ppm) and elevated manganese content can be carried out with a reasonably low dose of 31 mSv to the hand. Sixty-three percent of the total dose equivalent is delivered by non-useful fast group (> 10 keV); the filtration of this neutron group from the beam will further decrease the dose equivalent to the patient's hand

The role of irradiation and radiation dose levels is poorly defined. This study reviews a single institution experience using both, conventional and high doses > or = 60 Gy/CGE radiation regimen. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1974 and 1995 16 patients with histologically proven malignant meningioma underwent radiation therapy (RT). Age at diagnosis ranged between 6 and 79 years (median: 49 years). Three patients reported previous irradiation to the head at least 14 years prior to diagnosis. Ten patients were treated for primary, and 6 patients for recurrent disease. Six patients underwent gross total and 10 patients subtotal resection (Table 1). RT was delivered using conventional, megavoltage photons or combined 160 MeV proton and photon irradiation. Except 1 patient, who died during RT, the radiation doses ranged between 40 and 70 Gy/CGE (= Cobalt Gray Equivalent) (median: 58 Gy/CGE, Table 2). RESULTS: With median observation time of 59 months (range: 10 to 155 months), actuarial local control rates at 5 and 8 years were 52% and 17%, respectively. Target doses > or = Gy/CGE resulted in significantly improved tumor control (100%) compared to < 60 Gy/CGE (17%) (p = 0.0006, Table 3 and Figure 1). Improved local control translated also in increased overall survival: 87% (> or = 60 Gy/CGE) versus 15% (< 60 Gy/CGE) at 5 years (p = 0.025, Figure 2). At time of analysis, 6/16 patients (38%) were alive. Two patients developed symptomatic brain damage at doses of 59.3 and 72 Gy/CGE. CONCLUSION: Conformal, radiation therapy with target doses > or = 60 Gy/CGE, in this study by use of combined proton and photon irradiation, can significantly improve chances of long-term local control and survival for patients diagnosed with these challenging tumors

Twelve patients received silicone tubes and were compared to a control group of 12 patients with irradiated nasal tumors without silicone tubes. Symptoms of nasolacrimal duct obstruction and epiphora were evaluated by means of a questionnaire. All patients had nasolacrimal duct irrigation. Patients intubated before irradiation maintained patency (11 of 12), whereas those in the control group did not (zero of 12) (P less than .0014); ten of 12 control patients had closure of both superior and inferior puncta. No significant difference in symptoms of epiphora was observed between the two groups

Comparison is made with 79 patients treated by subtotal surgery alone from 1962-1980. Progression-free survival for 17 patients irradiated after initial incomplete surgery was 88% at 8 years compared with 48% for similar patients treated by surgery alone (p = 0.057). 16 patients incompletely resected at time of first recurrence were irradiated and 78% were progression-free at 8 years while 11% of a similar group treated by surgery alone were progression free (p = 0.001). Long term overall survival was high and similar in both control and study groups. Two patients were irradiated at second recurrence and 1 patient at third recurrence. Twenty-five patients were treated with photons alone and have a median follow-up of 57 months, 6 patients have recurred at doses 45-60 Gy. Eleven patients were treated with combined 10 MV photons and 160 MV protons utilizing 3-D treatment planning. These patients have been followed for a median of 53 months and none have failed to date. Eight of 11 received 54-60.4 Gy and 3/11 greater than 64.48 Gy. Sex, age, pathology grade and score, surgery and timing of radiation therapy were not associated with significant differences in failure patterns within the irradiated study group (p less than 0.1).

Eleven patients were initially treated with x-ray at doses of 16.2-50.4 (mean 42.5) Gy, followed by proton beam at doses of 30.0-52.9 (mean 37.6) Gy. The other four patients were treated with proton beams alone at total doses of 75.0-88.5 (mean 81.4) Gy. The mean total dose for the 15 patients was 80.4 Gy. As a result, the primary tumor lesions of all 15 patients disappeared and complete responses were obtained. Approximately four to five months later, nine of the 15 patients developed esophageal ulcer formations at the circumferences of their primary lesions. The ulcerations were healed, however, by conservative management. There was no evidence of local recurrence throughout the observations on six cases of superficial carcinoma. Among nine advanced carcinoma patients, three relapsed into esophageal carcinoma. Recurrences were observed eight, 16 and 44 months, respectively, after the treatment. Ten of the 15 patients died, but eight died of other diseases. Three of four cases at autopsy did not show any cancer cells in irradiated primary lesions. Four of the 15 patients lived for over five years. The results suggest that a high dose of irradiation delivered by a well-defined proton field could result in improved local control and long-term survival in esophageal carcinoma without undue risk of injury to primary and adjacent organs

Adjustments were made for known prognostic factors including age, tumor location, tumor height, and clinical estimate of tumor diameter (for enucleated patients this was estimated in a regression equation relating histologic to clinical measurement). The overall rate ratio for all cause mortality was 1.2 (95% confidence interval, 0.9-1.6) for the concurrent enucleation series versus proton beam, and 1.6 (95% confidence interval, 1.2-2.1) for the earlier enucleation series versus proton beam. Relative rates of metastatic death, cancer death, and all cause mortality comparing alternative treatments were found to vary with time after treatment. Interval-specific rate ratios were evaluated using proportional hazards models fitted to separate time intervals after treatment. For all three outcomes, rate ratios were over two and statistically significant for the first 2 years after treatment and closer to one and nonsignificant after year 6 comparing the two enucleation groups with proton beam. Results suggest that treatment choice has little overall influence on survival in patients with uveal melanoma

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1987 and 1990, a pilot study (Protocol-1) was initially conducted in 16 patients to investigate the efficacy of chemoradiotherapy where RT was combined with TURB and continuous IA infusion of cisplatin. We then performed a regimen of possible bladder-preservation treatment (Protocol-2) in which 19 patients were treated with combination of TURB, full-dose RT and one-shot IA infusion of cisplatin and methotrexate. In RT small pelvis irradiation was performed with x-rays followed by proton beam boost irradiation to the original tumor site. RESULTS: Among patients treated on Protocol-1, a tumor-free bladder was observed in 50% (2/4) after 50-76 Gy but only 8% (1/14) after 30-40 Gy. In this regimen, planned cystectomy was performed in 10 patients and 13 patients (81%) are alive. Among 19 patients treated on Protocol-2, 17 patients (89%) are alive and 13 patients (68%) retained intact bladders without any recurrence. There were 3 cystectomies performed because of persistent tumors. Using a conformal mode of proton beam irradiation, a total dose of 60-80 Gy was safely administered with acceptable morbidities. CONCLUSION: In the light of good complete response and survival rates achieved in the patients treated on Protocol-2, the combined treatment of definitive RT and IA administration of chemotherapy is considered as an effective bladder-preserving strategy	
1	38	Management of Irish patients with intraocular melanoma referred to Liverpool, England	Brachytherapy, Combined Modality Therapy, England, Eye Enucleation, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Ireland, Male, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Melanoma/su [Surgery], Melanoma/th [Therapy], Middle Aged, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Referral and Consultation, Retrospective Studies, Treatment Outcome, Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Uveal Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Uveal Neoplasms/th [Therapy], Visual Acuity	PURPOSE: This study reviews the results of patients referred from Ireland for treatment of an intraocular melanoma at the Ocular Oncology Service at St Paul's Eye Unit, Liverpool. PATIENTS AND METHODS: There were 57 patients with a median age of 55 years. Management included plaque radiotherapy (14), proton beam radiotherapy (17), local resection (10), endoresection (6), and enucleation (10). Fifty-two tumours involved the choroid. The tumours had a mean diameter of 11.4 mm and a mean thickness of 5.2 mm. RESULTS: The follow-up period had a median of 267 days. Retention of the eye was achieved in all 47 cases who underwent conservative management. Ninety percent of patients retained a vision of counting fingers, with an acuity of 6/12 or better in 50%. CONCLUSION: This group of patients gives an indication of the results that can be expected when uveal melanoma is managed by a variety of conservative techniques in a specialised ocular oncology service	
0	71	Ultrasonographic follow-up of primary choroidal malignant melanoma after proton beam irradiation therapy	Aged, Aged,80 and over, Choroid Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Choroid Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Choroid Neoplasms/us [Ultrasonography], Fluorescein Angiography, Follow-Up Studies, Fundus Oculi, Humans, Image Enhancement, Melanoma/pa [Pathology], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Melanoma/us [Ultrasonography], Middle Aged, Mitosis, Protons, Reproducibility of Results, Treatment Outcome, Video Recording, Visual Acuity	The aim of this study is to evaluate the ultrasonographic aspects of primary choroidal malignant melanoma (PCMM) after proton beam irradiation therapy and the reliability of its ultrasonographic follow-up in a series of 10 patients. All patients were examined with standardized A and B scan ultrasonography before and after treatment with proton beam irradiation therapy. The follow-up was carried out at 1, 3, 5, 8 months and then every 6 months. The mean follow-up was 20 months (range 6-34 months). The thickness of the tumors was demonstrated to be decreased and the internal reflectivity to be enhanced in 9 out of 10 cases from 8 months after treatment till the end of the follow-up period. Histopathology confirmed in 1 eye enucleated 5 months after treatment that medium-low internal reflectivity coresponded with several areas of high cellularity and cellular mitosis. The results of our study indicate the reliability of standardized A and B scan echography in the follow-up of PCMM treated with proton beam irradiation therapy

Due to the anatomically challenging position of the lesion, a three-field technique was adopted in which fields incident through the lungs and heart, as well as beams directed directly at the spinal cord, could be avoided. A homogeneous target dose and sparing of the spinal cord was achieved through field patching and computer optimization of the 3D fluence of each field. Sensitivity of the resultant plan to delivery and calculational errors was determined through both the assessment of the potential effects of range and patient setup errors, and by the application of Monte Carlo dose calculation methods. Ionization chamber profile measurements and 2D dosimetry using a scintillator/CCD camera arrangement were performed to verify the calculated fields in water. Modeling of a 10% overshoot of proton range showed that the maximum dose to the spinal cord remained unchanged, but setup error analysis showed that dose homogeneity in the target volume could be sensitive to offsets in the AP direction. No significant difference between the MC and analytic dose calculations was found and the measured dosimetry for all fields was accurate to 3% for all measured points. Over the course of the treatment, a setup accuracy of +/-4 mm (2 s.d.) could be achieved, with a mean offset in the AP direction of 0.1 mm. Inhalation/exhalation CT scans indicated that organ motion in the region of the target volume was negligible. We conclude that 3D IMPT plans can be applied clinically and safely without modification to our existing delivery system. However, analysis of the calculated intensity matrices should be performed to assess the practicality, or otherwise, of the plan

DESIGN AND SETTING: Nonrandomized prospective study of a case series in a tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: Nine consecutive patients with newly diagnosed esthesioneuroblastoma or neuroendocrine carcinoma of the paranasal sinuses from June 1992 to October 1995 underwent this treatment protocol. INTERVENTIONS: After histological diagnosis and detailed imaging, 2 cycles of cisplatin and etoposide chemotherapy were instituted. Chemotherapy responders were treated with combined photon and stereotaxic fractionated proton radiation therapy totaling approximately 68 Gy to the primary site, whereas poor responders were treated with surgical resection followed by postoperative radiation. In both cases, therapy was then concluded with 2 additional cycles of cisplatin and etoposide chemotherapy. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Response to therapy, survival, disease-free survival, and complications of therapy were examined. RESULTS: Nine patients with a median Dulguerov T stage of T3 (range, T2 to T4) completed the treatment protocol, with mean follow-up after diagnosis of 20.5 months. Eight of 9 patients exhibited a dramatic response to therapy with remission of their tumor, and resection was not required. One patient failed to respond to induction chemotherapy and received surgical therapy to be followed by postoperative radiotherapy. There have been no recurrences (mean disease-free interval of 14.0 months). Complications were limited and generally transient. CONCLUSIONS: The use of combined cisplatin and etoposide chemotherapy with proton radiation has demonstrated initial success in treatment of these tumors. Dramatic response from chemotherapy is possible even in bulky or unresectable disease. This protocol has an acceptable complication rate and conveys less morbidity than craniofacial resection and conventional radiotherapy. Further follow-up will be required to determine the long-term success rate of this therapeutic protocol	
0	4215	Importance of precise positioning for proton beam therapy in the base of skull and cervical spine	Adult, Boston, Brain, Brain Stem, Cervical Vertebrae, Child, Chordoma, Chordoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Humans, Immobilization, Male, Massachusetts, Middle Aged, Probability, Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Research, Skull, Skull Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Spinal Cord, Spinal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Temporal Lobe, Uncertainty, X-Rays	Using proton beam therapy, high doses have been delivered to chordomas and chondrosarcomas of the base of skull and cervical spine. Dose inhomogeneity to the tumors has been accepted in order to maintain normal tissue tolerances, and detailed attention to patient immobilization and to precise positioning has minimized the margins necessary to ensure these dose constraints. This study examined the contribution of precise positioning to the better dose localization achieved in these treatments. Three patients whose tumors represented different anatomic geometries were studied. Treatment plans were developed which treated as much of the tumor as possible to 74 Cobalt-Gray-Equivalent (CGE) while maintaining the central brain stem and central spinal cord at less than or equal to 48 CGE, the surface of the brain stem, surface of the spinal cord, and optic structures at less than or equal to 60 CGE, and the temporal lobes at less than or equal to 5% likelihood of complication using a biophysical model of normal tissue complication probability. Two positioning accuracies were assumed: 3 mm and 10 mm. Both proton beam plans and 10 MV X ray beam plans were developed with these assumptions and dose constraints. In all cases with the same positioning uncertainties, the proton beam plans delivered more dose to a larger percentage of the tumor volume and the estimated tumor control probability was higher than with the X ray plans. However, without precise positioning both the proton plans and the X ray plans deteriorated, with a 12% to 25% decrease in estimated tumor control probability. In all but one case, the difference between protons with good positioning and poor positioning was greater than the difference between protons and X rays, both with good positioning. Hence in treating these tumors, which are in close proximity to critical normal tissues, attention to immobilization and precise positioning is essential. With good positioning, proton beam therapy permits higher doses to significantly more of the tumor in these sites than do X rays	
0	1042	Spot-scanning proton radiation therapy for recurrent, residual or untreated intracranial meningiomas.[see comment]	Adolescent, Adult, Child, Dose Fractionation, Female, Humans, Male, Meningeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Meningioma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Necrosis, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/rt [Radiotherapy], Neoplasm,Residual, Proportional Hazards Models, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage/st [Standards], Radiotherapy,Adjuvant, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Recurrence, Safety, Survival, Survival Analysis, Switzerland, Time, Treatment Outcome	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To assess the safety and efficacy of spot scanning proton beam radiation therapy (PRT) in the treatment of intracranial meningiomas. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixteen patients with intracranial meningioma (histopathologically proven in 13/16 cases) were treated with PRT between July 1997 and July 2002. Eight patients had skull base lesions. Thirteen patients received PRT after surgery either as adjuvant therapy for incomplete resection (eight patients) or for recurrence (five patients). Three patients received radical PRT after presumptive diagnosis based on imaging. The median prescribed dose was 56 CGE (range, 52.2-64, CGE=proton Gy X 1.1) at 1.8-2.0 CGE (median, 2.0) per fraction. Gross tumor volume and planning target volume ranged from 0.8 to 87.6 cc (median, 17.5) and 4.6-208.1 cc (median 107.7), respectively. Late ophthalmologic and non-ophthalmologic toxicity was assessed using the Subjective, Objective, Management and Analytic scale (SOMA) of the Late Effects of Normal Tissue scoring system and National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, v3.0) grading system, respectively. The median follow-up time was 34.1 months (range, 6.5-67.8). RESULTS: Cumulative 3-year local control, progression-free survival and overall survival were 91.7, 91.7 and 92.7%, respectively. No patient died from recurrent meningioma. One patient progressed locally after PRT. Radiographic follow-up (median, 34 months) revealed an objective response in three patients and stable disease in 12 patients. Cumulative 3-year toxicity free survival was 76.2%. One patient presented with radiation induced optic neuropathy (SOMA Grade 3) and retinopathy (SOMA Grade 2) 8.8 and 30.4 months after treatment, respectively. These patients with ophthalmologic toxicity received doses higher than those allowed for the optic/ocular structures. Another patient developed a symptomatic brain necrosis (CTCAE Grade 4) 7.2 months after treatment. No radiation-induced hypothalamic/pituitary dysfunction was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Spot-scanning PRT is an effective treatment for patient with untreated, recurrent or incompletely resected intracranial meningiomas. It offers highly conformal irradiation for complex-shaped intracranial meningiomas, while delivering minimal non-target dose. Observed ophthalmologic toxicity is dose-related

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eighty-four patients were randomized to pion therapy (33-34.5 Gy pi), or conventional photon irradiation (60 Gy). Entry criteria included astrocytoma (modified Kernohan high Grade 3 or Grade 4), age 18-70, Karnofsky performance status (KPS) > or = 50, ability to start irradiation within 30 days of surgery, unifocal tumor, and treatment volume < 850 cc. The high-dose volume in both arms was computed tomography enhancement plus a 2-cm margin. The study was designed with the power to detect a twofold difference between arms. RESULTS: Eighty-one eligible patients were equally balanced for all known prognostic variables. Pion patients started radiation 7 days earlier on average than photon patients, but other treatment-related variables did not differ. There were no significant differences for either early or late radiation toxicity between treatment arms. Actuarial survival analysis shows no differences in terms of time to local recurrence or overall survival where median survival was 10 months in both arms (p = 0.22). The physician-assessed KPS and patient-assessed quality of life (QOL) measurements were generally maintained within 10 percentage points until shortly before tumor recurrence. There was no apparent difference in the serial KPS or QOL scores between treatment arms. CONCLUSION: In contrast to high linear energy transfer (LET) therapy for central nervous system tumors, such as neutron or neon therapy, the safety of pion therapy, which is of intermediate LET, has been reaffirmed. However, this study has demonstrated no therapeutic gain for pion therapy of glioblastoma	
0	3435	Role of stereotactic radiosurgery with a linear accelerator in treatment of intracranial arteriovenous malformations and tumors in children	Adolescent, Boston, Brain, Brain Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Cerebral Angiography, Child, Child,Preschool, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/ra [Radiography], Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/rt [Radiotherapy], Male, Massachusetts, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/ra [Radiography], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/rt [Radiotherapy], Particle Accelerators, Patient Care Planning, Radiation, Radiosurgery, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Remission Induction, Stereotaxic Techniques, Stereotaxic Techniques/is [Instrumentation], Tomography,X-Ray Computed	Between 1986 and 1988, 16 children were treated for 10 arteriovenous malformations and 6 recurrent intracranial tumors with stereotactic radiation therapy using a modified Clinac 6/100 linear accelerator. The median age of our patients was 10.5 years. For the group with arteriovenous malformation, follow-up ranged from 6 months to 37 months (median was 20 months). No patient bled during the follow-up period. Five of eight patients with follow-up longer than 12 months have achieved complete obliteration of their arteriovenous malformation by angiogram. The four remaining patients who have not achieved a complete obliteration are awaiting their 2-year posttreatment angiogram. The other patient has been treated within the year and have not yet been studied. Five of the six recurrent tumor patients are alive with a median follow-up of 8 months. The remaining patient was controlled locally, but he died of recurrent disease outside the area treated with radiosurgery. The radiographic responses of these patients have included three complete responses, two substantial reductions in tumor volume (greater than 50%) and one stabilization. Despite previous radiotherapy, there have been no significant complications in these patients. We conclude that stereotactic radiation therapy using a standard linear accelerator is an effective and safe technique in the treatment of selected intracranial arteriovenous malformations and tumors in children. In addition, stereotactic radiosurgery may have unique applications in the treatment of localized primary and recurrent pediatric brain tumors

The patients were treated with (1) a 60Co machine equipped with 45-degree wedge filters, at a total dose of 6,000-7,000 cGy, 300 cGy per fraction, 3 days a week in the period from 1970-1974; (2) 10 MeV linear accelerator X-rays from 1975-1980, and (3) 10 MeV linear accelerator X-rays and/or the 60Co machine in the period from 1981-1985, at a total dose of 6,000-7,000 cGy, 5 days a week by parallel opposing portals without wedge filters. The 5-year local control rates by radiotherapy alone were 66%, 78%, and 83%, respectively, in the three periods, and the 5-year survival rates were 77%, 97%, and 96% following salvage surgery for recurrent disease. In the 1970-1974 period, four patients developed severe laryngeal edema, and two patients had total laryngectomy without local residual tumor. In the 1975-1985 period, 16 patients had local recurrence in five years, and in five of them the tumor exhibited verrucous-like histopathological findings. In the 1975-1980 period, local recurrence was considered to result from underdosing of lesions with 10 MV X-ray beams and split-course irradiation. In the last five years of the period, the 5-year local control rate for stage I and II carcinoma of the glottis, excluding verrucous-like carcinoma, reached 90% with 10 MV X-rays combined with 60Co gamma-rays

METHODS: The study was a retrospective nonrandomized investigation. Seventeen consecutive patients, referred to the Institut Gustave-Roussy, Villejuif, France, for circumscribed choroidal hemangioma associated with serous retinal detachment were studied. Each eye received a total dose of 20 cobalt gray equivalents (CGEs) delivered in 15-second fractions of 5 CGEs over 4 days. Functional tests included the initial and final best-corrected visual acuity, slitlamp examination, intraocular pressure, fundus examination, fluorescein angiography, and indocyanine green angiography. Tumor thickness was determined on B-scan ultrasonography. RESULTS: The macula was involved in 7 eyes and the lesion was juxtapapillary in 2 eyes. The mean (SD) tumor thickness was 3.06 (9.0) mm. The mean initial tumor diameter was 6.82 mm (range, 3.2-12.1 mm). The right eye was involved in 7 cases and the left eye in 10 cases. The mean (SD) follow-up period was 52 (58) months (range, 36-90 months). Retinal reattachment was obtained in all cases after a mean period of 2 months (range, 1-12 months; median, 1 month). Tumor regression was obtained in all cases. One recurrence occurred 1 year after the initial treatment in an undertreated area. After re-treatment, however, resolution of the retinal detachment occurred, and flattening of the choroidal lesion was obtained. Final visual acuity improved to 2 Snellen lines or more in 16 eyes (94%), was stable in 1 eye, and attained 20/40 or more in 12 eyes (70.6%). No radiation therapy complications occurred during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy for choroidal hemangiomas seems to be an effective and safe alternative option. A total dose of 20 CGEs delivered in 4 daily 15-second fractions of 5 CGEs seems adequate for local control of both the tumor and serous retinal detachment

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The charts of 6 patients (7 eyes) with Sturge-Weber syndrome and choroidal hemangiomas were reviewed. An exudative retinal detachment was the indication for treatment in all cases. The mean age of the 6 patients was 13 years (range, 4 to 20 years). The minimum follow-up time was 1 year. Patients were checked for initial and final best-corrected visual acuity, fundus examination, fluorescein angiography, and tumor thickness on B-scan ultrasonography. The patients were treated with radiotherapy. A total dose of 20 Grays was applied to 7 eyes: 2 with a circumscribed choroidal hemangioma underwent proton therapy and 5 with diffuse hemangioma were treated by external beam irradiation. RESULTS: Complete resolution of the subretinal fluid was achieved in all cases with the tumor height decreased. Visual acuity improved to 1 line or more in 5 eyes and remained stable in 2 eyes. Two cases that underwent proton therapy developed radiation retinopathy. CONCLUSION: External beam radiation is an effective and safe option in the management of choroidal hemangiomas complicated by retinal detachment. Based on our experience, proton therapy should be reserved for sporadic circumscribed choroidal hemangioma	
1	2625	Is immediate chest radiotherapy obligatory for any or all patients with limited-stage non-small cell carcinoma of the lung? Yes	Adenocarcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Carcinoma,Small Cell/rt [Radiotherapy], Carcinoma,Squamous Cell/rt [Radiotherapy], Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Energy Transfer, Evaluation Studies as Topic, Humans, Linear Energy Transfer, Lung, Lung Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Neoplasm Metastasis, Prognosis, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Survivors	External irradiation with the greatest technical sophistication available is indicated in all patients with inoperable non-small cell carcinoma of the lung confined to the primary site and to regional lymph nodes including the ipsilateral supraclavicular nodes. Irradiation with moderately high doses results in responses in 40%-65% of all patients. With irradiation to a level of at least 6000 rad in 30 fractions in 6 weeks, greater than 60% of patients never fail in the chest. Some of these patients become long-term, disease-free survivors. Until it is possible clearly to predict those patients who do not respond and thereby to justify an approach other than thoracic irradiation, it is necessary to offer radiation therapy to all of these patients. Since local control is far from satisfactory, one can certainly justify investigating new approaches, including further increases of the total dose, altered fractionation schemes, addition of radiosensitizers, and high linear energy transfer radiations. Since distant metastases frequently appear in spite of thorough pretreatment evaluations, one can also justify investigating the addition of systemic agents, both cytotoxic drugs and biologic response modifiers. Benefit from these systemic approaches may be completely masked, even in patients with disseminated disease, by failure to prevent complications and death due to the intrathoracic tumor

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Four hundred and twenty-one cases of NPC, treated in the Cancer Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University of Medical Sciences (SUMS), with computed tomography scanning before initial radiotherapy, are analyzed. Important prognostic factors that form the basis of the new staging system are screened out by means of Cox model and clinical experiences. Survival curves of various kinds of T and N stages are compared by computer simulation. A new staging system is proposed by studying the traditional staging systems such as the AJC, UICC, Ho's and Changsha systems. RESULTS: According to the new staging criteria, the 5-year survival rates for Stages I-IV are 89.7%, 75.9%, 51.3%, and 22.2%, respectively. CONCLUSION: This new clinical staging for NPC based on a large amount of cases multivariate analysis is satisfactory and widely used in China

METHODS AND MATERIALS: We evaluated 37 consecutive patients treated with stereotactic radiation therapy for acoustic neuroma. All patients had progressive tumors, progressive symptoms, or both. Mean tumor diameter was 2.3 cm (range 0.8-3.3) on magnetic resonance (MR) scan. Dentate patients were given a dose of 5x4 Gy or 5x5 Gy and edentate patients were given a dose of 1x10 Gy or 1x12.50 Gy prescribed to the 80% isodose. All patients were treated with a single isocenter. RESULTS: With a mean follow-up period of 25 months (range 12-61), the actuarial local control rate at 5 years was 91% (only 1 patient failed). The actuarial rate of hearing preservation at 5 years was 66% in previously-hearing patients. The actuarial rate of freedom from trigeminal nerve toxicity was 97% at 5 years. No patient developed facial nerve toxicity or other complications. CONCLUSION: In this unselected series, fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy and linear accelerator-based radiosurgery give excellent local control in acoustic neuroma. It combines a high rate of preservation of hearing with a very low rate of other toxicity, although follow-up is relatively short	
0	1042	Spot-scanning proton radiation therapy for recurrent, residual or untreated intracranial meningiomas.[see comment]	Adolescent, Adult, Child, Dose Fractionation, Female, Humans, Male, Meningeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Meningioma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Necrosis, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/rt [Radiotherapy], Neoplasm,Residual, Proportional Hazards Models, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage/st [Standards], Radiotherapy,Adjuvant, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Recurrence, Safety, Survival, Survival Analysis, Switzerland, Time, Treatment Outcome	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To assess the safety and efficacy of spot scanning proton beam radiation therapy (PRT) in the treatment of intracranial meningiomas. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixteen patients with intracranial meningioma (histopathologically proven in 13/16 cases) were treated with PRT between July 1997 and July 2002. Eight patients had skull base lesions. Thirteen patients received PRT after surgery either as adjuvant therapy for incomplete resection (eight patients) or for recurrence (five patients). Three patients received radical PRT after presumptive diagnosis based on imaging. The median prescribed dose was 56 CGE (range, 52.2-64, CGE=proton Gy X 1.1) at 1.8-2.0 CGE (median, 2.0) per fraction. Gross tumor volume and planning target volume ranged from 0.8 to 87.6 cc (median, 17.5) and 4.6-208.1 cc (median 107.7), respectively. Late ophthalmologic and non-ophthalmologic toxicity was assessed using the Subjective, Objective, Management and Analytic scale (SOMA) of the Late Effects of Normal Tissue scoring system and National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, v3.0) grading system, respectively. The median follow-up time was 34.1 months (range, 6.5-67.8). RESULTS: Cumulative 3-year local control, progression-free survival and overall survival were 91.7, 91.7 and 92.7%, respectively. No patient died from recurrent meningioma. One patient progressed locally after PRT. Radiographic follow-up (median, 34 months) revealed an objective response in three patients and stable disease in 12 patients. Cumulative 3-year toxicity free survival was 76.2%. One patient presented with radiation induced optic neuropathy (SOMA Grade 3) and retinopathy (SOMA Grade 2) 8.8 and 30.4 months after treatment, respectively. These patients with ophthalmologic toxicity received doses higher than those allowed for the optic/ocular structures. Another patient developed a symptomatic brain necrosis (CTCAE Grade 4) 7.2 months after treatment. No radiation-induced hypothalamic/pituitary dysfunction was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Spot-scanning PRT is an effective treatment for patient with untreated, recurrent or incompletely resected intracranial meningiomas. It offers highly conformal irradiation for complex-shaped intracranial meningiomas, while delivering minimal non-target dose. Observed ophthalmologic toxicity is dose-related

This study was to evaluate the influence of radiotherapy on the survival of stage IV NSCLC patients. METHODS: Clinical data of 287 patients with stage IV NSCLC were retrospectively analyzed. Whole brain was treated with two parallel fields irradiation; bone metastases were treated with one local field irradiation. Primary tumors, regional lymph nodes and other distant metastases were treated by conventional fractionation radiotherapy or 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy. Whole brain and bone radiotherapy was delivered with a total dose of 40 Gy in 20 fractions in 4 weeks or with a total dose of 30 Gy in 10 fractions in 2 weeks. The median dose for primary tumors and regional lymph nodes was 50 Gy (20-70 Gy), and the median dose for other distant metastases was 46 Gy (40-60 Gy). RESULTS: The median survival time of the 287 patients was 9 months (8-10 months). The 1- and 2-year overall survival rates were 30.2% and 8.9%. The median survival time was significantly longer in the patients received chemotherapy than in the patients didn't (10 months vs. 8 months, P = 0.049). In the patients with brain, bone, or other distant metastases, the median survival time was 8, 9, and 10 months, respectively; the 1-year survival rates were 24.8%, 28.7%, and 37.5%, respectively; the 2-year survival rates were 6.7%, 7%, and 15.3%, respectively. By unitivariate analysis, histological type and patients' age were prognostic factors of NSCLC. The median survival time was significantly longer in adenocarcinoma patients than in squamous cell carcinoma patients and other carcinoma patients (10 months vs. 7 and 9 months, P = 0.046), longer in the patients of < or =60 years old than in those of >60 years old (11 months vs. 8 months, P = 0.012), and longer in the patients with only bone metastases than in the patients with concomitant other distant metastases (10 months vs. 6 months, P = 0.033), but there was no significant difference between the patients with only brain metastases and those with concomitant other distant metastases (9 months vs. 8 months, P = 0.374). Radiotherapy for primary tumors and lymph nodes, complications of other chronic diseases, and irradiation dose and pattern had no effect on the survival. CONCLUSIONS: Histological type and patients' age may affect the efficacy of radiotherapy on stage IV NSCLC. The irradiation patterns of 40 Gy in 20 fractions in 4 weeks or 30 Gy in 10 fractions in 2 weeks have no effect on the survival of patients with brain or bone metastases

METHODS: We studied the effects of interstitial brachytherapy on the brains of healthy monkeys and in humans with glioblastoma multiforme. The effects of radiation therapy on normal brain tissue in monkeys were assessed with sequential proton MR spectroscopic studies 1 week to 6 months after brachytherapy. Proton MR spectroscopy was also performed in five patients with residual/recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (three of whom had radiation necrosis after brachytherapy), seven patients with newly diagnosed untreated glioblastoma multiforme, and 16 healthy volunteers, who served as a control group. RESULTS: In monkeys, the ratio of N-acetylaspartate (NAA) to creatine-phosphocreatine (Cr) and the ratio of choline-containing compounds (Cho) to Cr of the reference point were significantly lower 1 week after brachytherapy than before treatment. The ratio of NAA to Cho of the irradiated area tended to be higher 1 week after brachytherapy than before irradiation. These peak metabolic ratios showed characteristic changes 6 months after treatment. In two of three monkeys, lipid signal was elevated 6 months after irradiation. In the clinical study, the ratio of NAA to Cho in the area of radiation necrosis was significantly different from that in glioblastoma multiforme when compared with the contralateral hemisphere after irradiation. In addition, lipid signal was detected in all patients with radiation necrosis. CONCLUSION: It might be possible to use proton MR spectroscopy to differentiate radiation necrosis from residual/recurrent glioblastoma multiforme on the basis of comparisons with the contralateral hemisphere after radiation therapy

T2 may be significantly prolonged within 2 h after ingestion of glucose and fructose due to changed water distribution in the melanoma. This method is used to follow melanomas for up to 6 years after proton beam irradiation. In the tumours, T2 was shortened in parallel in all the lesions during the first 9 months. After this, T2 increased only in tumours which showed recurrence. T2 determination and histopathological examination revealed no signs of recurrence in eyes which were enucleated due to neovascular glaucoma. It is concluded that MR imaging performed with carbohydrate loading, registers metabolic changes induced in the tumour, giving this method great validity in the follow-up of choroidal malignant melanoma after irradiation. Eighteen patients treated with proton beam for uveal melanoma at the cyclotron in Uppsala, Sweden, were followed

An electron beam with the energy of 7 MeV was produced on the small-size betatron, irradiation fields were formed, and absorbed dose distribution was studied. The efficacy of the use of the beam in 110 patients with superficial malignant tumors was analyzed. The use of electron beam radiation was found promising for therapy of patients with locally spread types of skin and lower lip cancers and breast cancer local recurrences. Complete tumor regression was noted in 75-90% of the patients. Intraoral cone electron therapy combined with 60Co-therapy of surgery was employed for early cancer of the oral cavity

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between December 1995 and December 1999, 17 patients received a treatment by 201-MeV proton beam at the Centre de Protontherapie d'Orsay (CPO) for a meningioma. Five patients presented a histologically atypical or malignant meningioma, twelve patients a benign one that was recurrent or rapidly progressive. In two cases radiotherapy was administered in the initial course of the disease and in 15 cases at the time of relapse. A highly conformal approach was used combining high-energy photons and protons for approximately 2/3 and 1/3 of the total dose. The median total dose delivered within gross tumor volume was 61 Cobalt Gray Equivalent CGE (25-69). RESULTS: Median follow-up was 37 months (17-60). The 4-year local control and overall survival rates were 87.5 +/- 12% and 88.9 +/- 11%, respectively. One patient failed locally within the clinical tumor volume. One patient died of intercurrent disease. A complete or partial clinical improvement was seen in most of patients. Radiologically, there were eleven stable diseases and five partial responses. In 12/15 recurrent cases, the free interval after radiotherapy is longer than that achieved by the initial surgery. This radiotherapy was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: In both benign and more aggressive meningiomas, the combination of conformal photons and protons with a dose escalated by 10-15% offers clinical improvements in most patients as well as radiological long-term stabilization	
1	683	Comparison of conventional-dose vs high-dose conformal radiation therapy in clinically localized adenocarcinoma of the prostate: a randomized controlled trial.[see comment]	Adenocarcinoma/bl [Blood], Adenocarcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Aged, Humans, Male, Massachusetts, Middle Aged, Prostate, Prostate-Specific Antigen/bl [Blood], Prostatic Neoplasms/bl [Blood], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Conformal, Recurrence, Research, Risk, Survival Rate	CONTEXT: Clinically localized prostate cancer is very prevalent among US men, but recurrence after treatment with conventional radiation therapy is common. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the hypothesis that increasing the radiation dose delivered to men with clinically localized prostate cancer improves disease outcome. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Randomized controlled trial of 393 patients with stage T1b through T2b prostate cancer and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels less than 15 ng/mL randomized between January 1996 and December 1999 and treated at 2 US academic institutions. Median age was 67 years and median PSA level was 6.3 ng/mL. Median follow-up was 5.5 (range, 1.2-8.2) years. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomized to receive external beam radiation to a total dose of either 70.2 Gy (conventional dose) or 79.2 Gy (high dose). This was delivered using a combination of conformal photon and proton beams. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Increasing PSA level (ie, biochemical failure) 5 years after treatment. RESULTS: The proportions of men free from biochemical failure at 5 years were 61.4% (95% confidence interval, 54.6%-68.3%) for conventional-dose and 80.4% (95% confidence interval, 74.7%-86.1%) for high-dose therapy (P<.001), a 49% reduction in the risk of failure. The advantage to high-dose therapy was observed in both the low-risk and the higher-risk subgroups (risk reduction, 51% [P<.001] and 44% [P = .03], respectively). There has been no significant difference in overall survival rates between the treatment groups. Only 1% of patients receiving conventional-dose and 2% receiving high-dose radiation experienced acute urinary or rectal morbidity of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) grade 3 or greater. So far, only 2% and 1%, respectively, have experienced late morbidity of RTOG grade 3 or greater. CONCLUSIONS: Men with clinically localized prostate cancer have a lower risk of biochemical failure if they receive high-dose rather than conventional-dose conformal radiation. This advantage was achieved without any associated increase in RTOG grade 3 acute or late urinary or rectal morbidity

Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a mass 10 cm in diameter in the region of the middle clivus enhanced inhomogeneously by gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, and a defect in the skull base. There was evidence of compression of the anterior surface of the pons. He received proton irradiation employing a pair of parallel opposed lateral proton beams. The dose aimed at the tumor mass was 75.5 Gy, to the pharyngeal wall less than 38 Gy, and to the anterior portion of the pons less than 30 Gy. Time dose and fractionation factor was calculated at 148. Thirty-one months following treatment, he was free of clinical neurological sequelae. Proton therapy should be considered in treatment planning following initial surgical removal or for inoperable clivus chordoma

DESIGN: The study design was a retrospective review. PARTICIPANTS: Studied were 13 patients (13 eyes) who had circumscribed choroidal hemangioma associated with serous retinal detachment. Of these, four eyes previously underwent laser unsuccessfully. INTERVENTION: Proton therapy including a total dose of 30 Cobalt-Gray-Equivalent was administered to each eye. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patients were controlled for initial and final best-corrected visual acuity, slit-lamp examination, intraocular pressure, fundus examination, fluorescein angiography, and tumor thickness on B-scan ultrasonography. RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 26 months (range, 9-48 months). Retinal reattachment was obtained in all cases after a mean period of 52 days. The tumor height decreased in all cases. Visual acuity improved to two lines or more in eight eyes (62%) and reached 20/200 or more in nine eyes (69%). No radiation complication was detected during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Proton radiation seems to be effective and safe in the management of choroidal hemangioma associated with serous retinal detachment. It may be useful when photocoagulation can not be performed

Thirteen patients had carcinomas and three had sarcomas. All patients had complete pelvic surgery including extrafascial (or modified radical) hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, pelvic node sampling, evaluation of peritoneal cytology, and resection of extrauterine metastases when indicated. All patients were free of gross visible tumor after surgery. Target doses of radiation were 3000 cGy to the upper abdomen and 4500 cGy to the pelvis. Median follow-up was 24 months for survivors (range, 17 to 63 months). The disease-free survival and overall survival at 17 months was 50%. Six of the 16 (38%) patients suffered intraabdominal relapse. One patient had a significant complication (bowel perforation). The data from this pilot study suggest that whole abdominal-pelvic irradiation may be useful only in the management of some patients with few high risk features of endometrial carcinoma. Patients with extensive extra-uterine involvement and with sarcoma histology do not appear to benefit from this experimental therapy

We enrolled four NSCLC patients with chest wall invasion but without nodal and distant metastasis (T3N0M0). Only primary lesions were irradiated with carbon ions, followed by surgical resection. The patients consisted of three males and one female varying by age from 54 to 73 (average 66.3). Total treatment dose was 59.4 and 64.8 GyE, respectively, administered in 18 fractions over 6 weeks, or 72.0 GyE in 16 fractions over 4 weeks. Resection after radiation therapy was performed as a combination of lobectomy, lymph node dissection and chest wall surgery. After fixation, the lung was sliced into thin sections to match the CT image. Each slice was anatomically identified and the slices were compared with each other subjected to pathological analysis. No tumor cells were observed in two cases. The other two cases exhibited only a few tumor cells sparsely distributed in the lung tissue. There was evidence of dense pulmonary fibrosis in the limited space surrounding primary tumors, but its density was found to rapidly decrease in the narrow area toward the outside. The rate at which its density subsided mirrored the rapid decrease in the planning CT dose distribution. Microscopy showed no evidence of fibrosis in any of the fields irradiated with less than 15 GyE. Microscopy confirmed an outstanding tumor response with limited pulmonary fibrosis. This substantiates the superior dose localization and strong biological effect of carbon ion beams with a Bragg peak in the lung. The pathological findings have thus provided evidence of the safety and effectiveness of carbon beam therapy in the treatment of NSCLC

Eight patients received three weekly fractions of 0.7 to 1.33 Gy and two patients four weekly fractions of 0.8 Gy to total doses of 7.4 to 10.4 Gy. Two complete and six partial remissions of ataxia and motor disturbances were observed. Bladder dysfunctions in five patients cleared up partially in three cases. In two patients the symptomatology remained unchanged. After a follow-up of eight to 88 months two initially complete and two out of six partial remission were maintained. No severe late effects of the skin have been determined. In summary it is concluded that for incompletely resected "pencil"-gliomas fast neutron therapy seems to be a feasible treatment modality

METHODS: Nine ependymoma patients have been treated with SRS (four with linear accelerator and five with Gamma Knife) since 1990. Two patients had WHO grade III tumors, and the remaining seven had WHO grade II tumors. Eight of nine patients received external beam radiation therapy at some point prior to radiosurgery to a total median dose of 54 Gy. The radiosurgery dose ranged from 14 to 20 Gy. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 28 months. The median age of patients at diagnosis was 35 years. Four patients developed progressive disease following radiosurgery, and two patients have died of progressive disease. The 3-year relapse-free survival was 55.6%. The 3-year overall survival was 71.1%. Patients treated with radiosurgery as a component of initial treatment (generally as a boost following external beam) had an improved relapse-free survival (100%) compared to those treated with radiosurgery to salvage an external beam local failure (20%). CONCLUSION: SRS is an effective treatment for intracranial ependymoma. Further clinical trials are warranted incorporating radiosurgery as a component of initial management in selected ependymoma patients

Olfactory neuroblastoma is a rare disease, and a standard treatment strategy has not been established. Radiation therapy for ONB is challenging because of the proximity of ONBs to critical organs. Proton-beam therapy can provide better dose distribution compared with X-ray irradiation because of its physical characteristics, and is deemed to be a feasible treatment modality. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A retrospective review was performed on 14 patients who underwent PBT for ONB as definitive treatment at the National Cancer Center Hospital East (Kashiwa, Chiba, Japan) from November 1999 to February 2005. A total dose of PBT was 65 cobalt Gray equivalents (Gy(E)), with 2.5-Gy(E) once-daily fractionations. RESULTS: The median follow-up period for surviving patients was 40 months. One patient died from disseminated disease. There were two persistent diseases, one of which was successfully salvaged with surgery. The 5-year overall survival rate was 93%, the 5-year local progression-free survival rate was 84%, and the 5-year relapse-free survival rate was 71%. Liquorrhea was observed in one patient with Kadish's stage C disease (widely destroying the skull base). Most patients experienced Grade 1 to 2 dermatitis in the acute phase. No other adverse events of Grade 3 or greater were observed according to the RTOG/EORTC acute and late morbidity scoring system. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results of PBT for ONB achieved excellent local control and survival outcomes without serious adverse effects. Proton-beam therapy is considered a safe and effective modality that warrants further study

[French]	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Choroid Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Choroid Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Melanoma, Melanoma/pa [Pathology], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/pa [Pathology], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/rt [Radiotherapy], Neoplasm Staging, Protons, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Survival, Ultrasonography	Among the 934 patients with a choroidal melanoma treated in first intention with an accelerated proton beam since 1984, 41 (4.4%) presented an extrascleral extension, of which 11 were located anteriorly and 30 posteriorly. For these 30 cases, the diagnosis was made by B ultrasonography only when the volume of the extension was important, between 20 and 2280 mm3. The Cox model multi-variant analysis was used to study the statistically significant parameters in the development of an extrascleral extension. It appears that the maximal diameter of the intraocular tumor (p = 0.0012), the localisation of the anterior margin (p = 0.0304) and the age of the patients (p = 0.0097) are statistically meaningful. The 4 years' survival, studied with the Kaplan-Meier curves, is estimated at 60% for the patients with extrascleral extension and at 85% for the patients without. These results are similar to those of literature, whatever treatment is chosen (enucleation and radiotherapy, exenteration)	
0	1008	Potential outcomes of modalities and techniques in radiotherapy for patients with hypopharyngeal carcinoma	Carcinoma/pa [Pathology], Carcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Female, Humans, Hypopharyngeal Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Hypopharyngeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Male, Models,Theoretical, Neoplasm Staging, Probability, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Sweden, Treatment Outcome	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To determine potential improvements in treatment outcome for patients with hypopharyngeal carcinoma, T4N0M0, using proton and intensity modulated photon radiotherapy (IMRT) compared to a standard 3D conformal radiotherapy treatment (3D-CRT) in terms of local tumour control probability, TCP, and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) for the spinal cord and the parotid glands using. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using the three-dimensional treatment-planning system, Helax-TMS, 5 patients were planned with protons, IMRT, and 3D-CRT plans. The prescribed dose used was 30 fractions x 2.39 Gy for the protons and IMRT and 35 fractions x 2.00 Gy for 3D-CRT. The treatment plans were evaluated using dose volume data and dose response models were used to calculate TCP and NTCP. The target volumes were delineated to spare the parotid glands. A dose escalation was made for protons and IMRT using NTCP constraints to the spinal cord. RESULTS: On average, protons and IMRT increase TCP by 17% compared to 3D-CRT. For the spinal cord NTCP values are zero for all methods and patients. Average NTCP values for the parotid glands were >90% for 3D-CRT and significantly lower for protons and IMRT varying from 43-65%. The average parotid gland dose was 33 Gy for the protons, 38 Gy for IMRT and 48 Gy for 3D-CRT. CONCLUSIONS: Protons and IMRT gave a significant TCP increase compared to 3D-CRT while no significant difference between protons and IMRT was found. Protons generally show lower non-target tissue doses, which indicates a possibility for further dose escalation. Large individual dose differences between protons and IMRT for parotid glands indicate that some patients may benefit more from protons and others from IMRT	
0	891	Preliminary assessment of magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging in predicting treatment outcome in patients with prostate cancer at high risk for relapse.[see comment]	Disease-Free Survival, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Male, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local, Neoplasm Staging, Physics, Predictive Value of Tests, Prognosis, Prostate, Prostate-Specific Antigen, Prostatectomy, Prostatic Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Radiation, Research, Risk, Risk Assessment, Sensitivity and Specificity, Treatment Outcome	The purpose of the study was to determine whether 3D proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) can predict treatment outcome in high risk patients with prostate cancer. Endorectal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 1H-MRSI were performed in 16 patients with prostate cancer who were considered high risk because of clinical stage T3-4, Gleason score>/=8, and/or prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level>20 ng/mL. Patients were treated with chemotherapy/hormone therapy, underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) or radiation therapy, and were followed for PSA relapse (follow-up, 19-43 months). The ratio of choline plus creatine to citrate was used to localize peripheral zone cancer. An MRSI risk score on a scale of 0-3 was derived from the volume and degree of metabolic abnormality. Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging risk score, MRI tumor/node (TN) stage, clinical stage, Gleason score, and PSA were used as predictors of pathologic stage in patients treated with RP (n=10) and PSA relapse in all patients. Magnetic resonance imaging TN stage (P<0.01) and MRSI risk score (P<0.05) correlated with pathologic stage, but clinical stage did not (P=0.35). Magnetic resonance imaging TN stage was the only significant predictor of PSA relapse in the univariate analysis (P<0.05). Although the MRSI risk score did not reach significance (P=0.13), 6 patients with a score<0.9 were relapse-free, whereas 7 of 10 patients with a score>0.9 relapsed. Magnetic resonance imaging and MRSI risk assessments agreed in 15 of 16 patients. These preliminary results suggest that tumor metabolic assessment may indicate treatment outcome in high-risk patients with prostate cancer. Although MRSI did not provide added prognostic value to MRI in this small number of patients, MRSI might increase the confidence of the clinician in assessing risk on MRI by contributing supporting metabolic data

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a phase I/II dose escalation study of carbon ion radiotherapy. Fifty-seven patients with 64 sites of bone and soft tissue sarcomas not suited for resection received carbon ion radiotherapy. Tumors involved the spine or paraspinous soft tissues in 19 patients, pelvis in 32 patients, and extremities in six patients. The total dose ranged from 52.8 to 73.6 gray equivalent (GyE) and was administered in 16 fixed fractions over 4 weeks (3.3 to 4.6 GyE/fraction). The median tumor size was 559 cm(3) (range, 20 to 2,290 cm(3)). The minimum follow-up was 18 months. RESULTS: Seven of 17 patients treated with the highest total dose of 73.6 GyE experienced Radiation Therapy Oncology Group grade 3 acute skin reactions. Dose escalation was then halted at this level. No other severe acute reactions (grade > 3) were observed in this series. The overall local control rates were 88% and 73% at 1 year and 3 years of follow-up, respectively. The median survival time was 31 months (range, 2 to 60 months), and the 1- and 3-year overall survival rates were 82% and 46%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Carbon ion radiotherapy seems to be a safe and effective modality in the management of bone and soft tissue sarcomas not eligible for surgical resection, providing good local control and offering a survival advantage without unacceptable morbidity

Protons offer an opportunity to increase the radiation dose to the prostate while minimizing treatment toxicity. METHODS: Six hundred forty-three patients with localized prostate cancer were treated with protons, with or without photons. Treatments were planned with a 3D planning system; patients received 74-75 CGE (Cobalt Gray Equivalent) at 1.8-2.0 CGE per fraction. Patients were evaluated for response to therapy and treatment-related toxicity. RESULTS: The overall clinical disease-free survival rate was 89% at 5 years. When post-treatment prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was used as an endpoint for disease control, the 4.5-year disease-free survival rate was 100% for patients with an initial PSA of < 4.0 ng/ml, and 89%, 72%, and 53% for patients with initial PSA levels of 4.1-10.0, 10.1-20.0, and > 20.0, respectively. Patients in whom the post-treatment PSA nadir was below 0.5 ng/ml did significantly better than those whose nadir values were between 0.51-1.0 or > 1.0 ng/ml: the corresponding 5-year disease-free survival rates were 91%, 79%, and 40%, respectively. Minimal radiation proctitis was seen in 21% of patients; toxicity of greater severity was seen in less than 1%. CONCLUSION: Proton therapy to 74-75 CGE produced minimal treatment-related toxicity and excellent PSA normalization and disease-free survival in patients with low initial PSA levels. A prospective randomized dose-escalation trial is now underway to help define the optimum dose of radiation for patients with early stage prostate cancer

[Russian]	Adult, Eye, Eye Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Humans, Male, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Mortality, Physics, Protons, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods]	This paper presents the effects of proton beam therapy of 175 patients with tumors of the eye. Irradiation was performed with a narrow medical proton beam (Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Physics) with the energy of 70 MeV (Bragg's peak). The total dose was 6000-7000 rad, irradiation frequency was 5-6 sessions every other day. Irradiation was used to treat intraocular and orbital melanomas, melanomas an cancer lesions of the eyelid and conjunctiva. According to the WHO classification, tumors fell under the T2-T3N0M0 stage. The follow-up periods varied from 1 to 10 years (an average of 3.4 years). Complete tumor regression was observed in 45% of the cases, partial regression in 39%, and the absence of the effect in 16%. Twenty-two patients (12%) underwent enucleation due to progressive tumor growth (16 patients) or postradiation complications (6 patients). Hematogenous metastases within a period of 2-5 years following irradiation were noted in 4% of the cases. The results obtained indicated a high efficacy of proton beam therapy for large ocular tumors. The mortality rate from metastases following irradiation was lower than that following enucleation

Some patients, however, develop adverse late effects following treatment and the purpose of this study was to determine which factors give rise to a poor local outcome. METHODS: The hospital records from a first cohort of 127 patients treated by protons from 1989 to 1992 were reviewed retrospectively. The presence of rubeosis was selected as a measure of significant ocular damage. Split file analysis was performed with 73 cases forming a test group with the remaining 54 cases acting as a validation group. RESULTS: Large tumour size and the presence of retinal detachment were significant, independent risk factors for developing rubeosis for both the test and validation groups. These factors also predicted subsequent enucleation for uncontrolled ocular pain. Patients with tumours too large to plaque and with an associated retinal detachment had a 90% chance of developing rubeosis within 4 years of proton beam radiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a uveal melanoma too large for plaque therapy and an associated retinal detachment run a very high risk of developing rubeosis after proton beam radiotherapy and one third of individuals developing rubeosis required enucleation for pain even if local tumour control was satisfactory

In extended tumours, ocular surface problems can result after therapy. In this study we examined ocular surface integrity of ten patients who underwent proton beam radiation between 1996 and 2002. METHODS: The patients were examined during their follow-up. Eight of the ten cases who underwent proton radiotherapy were recurrent tumours, which were previously treated with other adjuvant therapies. We performed a standard ophthalmological examination and detailed tear film diagnostics. RESULTS: The follow-up was 17-87 months (mean: 40.9+/-20.1). In six cases more than 50% of the upper and lower eyelids were included in the radiation field. All of these cases showed moderate to severe sicca symptoms. The impression cytology revealed squamous metaplasia of conjunctival cells in nine of ten cases. CONCLUSIONS: Squamous metaplasia of conjunctival epithelia indicates a radiogenic, persisting disturbance of differentiation of the conjunctival epithelial cells. The tear film instability correlates with the loss of mucin-secreting goblet cells and meibomian gland dysfunction

The potential of proton beam RT as an alternative to conventional brachytherapy was evaluated. Except for one local recurrence, 14 of 15 patients were locoregionally controlled for 15 to 57 months. Two-year local control rate and 2-year survival rate were 92.3% and 93.3%, respectively. Two cases of transient, radiation-induced proctitis (neither of which required surgical treatment) were the only complications despite a target dose that exceeded 8000 cGy in most cases. The results suggest that sharply localized, high-dose proton beam RT can produce an antitumor effect equivalent to that of conventional brachytherapy

This proton beam has the physical advantage of megavoltage x-rays of reducing the radiation dose to normal tissues adjacent to the tumor volume. A perineal proton technique used as boost therapy (2,000 to 2,500 rads) was evaluated in the definitive irradiation of 17 patients with localized prostatic carcinoma. This technique allows repeated daily treatment of the carefully defined target volume with a precision of +/- 2 mm. Total dose to the prostatic tumor, but not to the posterior rectum, has been increased by 500 to 700 rads. After 12 to 27 months of observation, no noteworthy rectal reaction has developed in a patient, easily managed urethral strictures have developed in two patients, and all but one are locally controlled

Surgical excision remains the treatment of choice, but the potential spinal cord injury may limit the extent of resection. We report the long-term results of treatment of six patients diagnosed with giant cell tumor of the spine treated with radiotherapy and review the literature regarding therapy. Between 1971 and 1995, six patients with GCTS were treated with conservative surgery and radiotherapy. The surgery consisted of either biopsy or subtotal resection of tumor. The involved vertebrae were then irradiated with doses ranging from 3000 to 5400 cGy. The mean follow-up was 13 years, and three of six patients had follow-up of 17 or more years. Five of six patients are alive with no evidence of disease. One is alive with disease, although it is not clinically apparent. No patient was lost to follow-up. We conclude that radiotherapy is useful in the management of GCTS and that conservative surgery with local radiotherapy is a reasonable treatment alternative for tumors that cannot be completely excised or in which surgery would result in significant functional morbidity. Although there is no clear dose response, review of the literature suggests that doses ranging from 3500 to 4500 cGy are safe and effective in controlling giant cell tumor. [References: 24]	
0	178	Assessment of the micronucleus assay as a biological dosimeter using cytokinesis-blocked lymphocytes from cancer patients receiving fractionated partial body-radiotherapy	Adult, Aged, Cell Division/re [Radiation Effects], Cobalt Radioisotopes, Dose Fractionation, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Female, Gamma Rays, Humans, Lymphocytes/cy [Cytology], Lymphocytes/pa [Pathology], Lymphocytes/re [Radiation Effects], Male, Micronucleus Tests, Middle Aged, Particle Accelerators, Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Reference Values, Research, Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	PURPOSE: To assess the suitability of the cytokinesis block micronucleus assay as a biological dosimeter following in-vivo radiation using cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy. METHODS: Blood from 4 healthy donors was irradiated in vitro with gamma-rays and the dose response of induced micronuclei in binucleate lymphocytes following cytokinesis block was determined. Micronucleus frequency was ascertained before and at intervals during radiotherapy treatment in 6 patients with various tumors in the pelvic region. Equivalent whole body doses (physical doses) at these times were calculated from radiation treatment plans and cumulative dose volume histograms. RESULTS: Linear dose response relationships were found for induced micronucleus frequency in lymphocytes resulting from both in-vitro and in-vivo irradiation. Doses resulting from in-vivo irradiation (biological doses) were estimated by substitution of micronucleus frequency observed in radiotherapy patients into the dose response curve from in-vitro irradiation of blood. The relationship between the biologically estimated dose (BD) and the calculated equivalent whole body dose (PD) was BD = 0.868 (+/- 0.043)PD + 0.117 (+/- 0.075). CONCLUSION: The micronucleus assay appears to offer a reliable and consistent method for equivalent whole body radiation dose estimation, although our findings should be confirmed using lymphocytes from radiotherapy patients with tumors at anatomical sites other than the pelvis. Except at doses lower than about ).4 Gy, the method yields dose estimates acceptably close to "true" physically determined doses. The assay can be performed relatively rapidly and can be used as a "first line" biological dosimeter in situations where accidental exposure to relatively high radiation doses has occurred	
1	156	High-dose conformal radiotherapy influenced the pattern of failure but did not improve survival in glioblastoma multiforme	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Analysis of Variance, Biopsy, Brain Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Brain Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Brain/pa [Pathology], Brain/re [Radiation Effects], Child, Female, Glioblastoma/mo [Mortality], Glioblastoma/ra [Radiography], Glioblastoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Multivariate Analysis, Necrosis, Particle Accelerators, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy/ae [Adverse Effects], Research, Survival Analysis, Survival Rate, Tomography,X-Ray Computed	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although glioblastoma multiforme is clearly radiation-resistant, there is evidence of a dose-dependent response relationship. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the impact of higher dose by rotational multileaf collimator (MLC) conformal radiation therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 1984 to 1995, 38 consecutive cases with intracranial glioblastoma multiforme were treated using the rotational MLC conformal therapy. There were 25 men and 13 women with a median age of 47 years (12-73 years, mean 46.5 years). Median Karnofsky performance score was 80 (30-100, mean 78.2). Median tumor volume was 64 cc (8-800 cc, mean 110.3 cc). All underwent surgical intervention (only biopsy in 1, partial resection in 13, subtotal resection in 21, and gross total resection in 3). Radiation dose to was 60 to 80 Gy (median 68.5 Gy, mean 68.3 Gy) in 21 patients treated before 1990 and 90 Gy in the 17 patients thereafter. Biweekly i.v. chemotherapy was also administered for both arms. RESULTS: The 1-year, 2-year, 5-year, and 10-year overall survival rates were 75%, 42%, 20%, and 15%, respectively. Univariate analysis showed the initial tumor volume, residual tumor volume, and Karnofsky performance score were statistically significant factors for survival. Only the residual tumor volume was statistically significant by multivariate analysis. The 5-year survival rate of patients with residual tumors of 5 cc or less in volume was as good as 37%. Survival of the 90-Gy Group appeared inferior to that of the Low-Dose Group, though no statistical difference was seen (the 3-year survival was 40% vs. 22%). Local failure was observed in 16 of the 19 recurrences in the Low-Dose Group, whereas it was observed in only 4 of the 13 recurrences in the 90-Gy Group. The difference in pattern of failure was statistically significant. Two patients of the High-Dose Group developed radiation necrosis and one died of it. CONCLUSIONS: The high-dose conformal radiotherapy did not improve survival in the disease, but did change the pattern of failure

Two cases of transient, radiation-induced proctitis (neither of which required surgical treatment) were the only complications despite a target dose that exceeded 8000 cGy in most cases.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixteen patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma initially treated with 50.0-88.2 Gy photons were re-treated with protons to additional doses of 59.4-70.2 CGE. Local-regional control and survival were correlated with extent of relapse, recurrence versus persistence, and prescribed dose and were subjected to dose-volume histogram analysis. Mean follow-up was 23.7 months (range, 4-47 months). RESULTS: Twenty-four-month actuarial overall and local-regional progression-free survival rates were both 50%. The 24-month actuarial overall survival rates for patients with "optimal" dose-volume histogram coverage versus "suboptimal" coverage were 83% and 17%, respectively (P = .006). Doses to critical structures were low (0-22.0 Gy); no central nervous system side effects supervened. CONCLUSION: Adequate tumor coverage, as evaluated by using dose-volume histogram analysis, was found to be the most important variable influencing local-regional control and survival. No central nervous system complications were observed; increases in the dose to adjacent critical structures are being evaluated

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Four-dimensional CT sets for 10 lung cancer patients were used in this study. The internal gross tumor volume (IGTV) was obtained by combining the tumor volumes at different phases of the respiratory cycle. For each patient, we evaluated four planning strategies based on the following dose calculations: (1) the average (AVE) CT; (2) the free-breathing (FB) CT; (3) the maximum intensity projection (MIP) CT; and (4) the AVE CT in which the CT voxel values inside the IGTV were replaced by a constant density (AVE_RIGTV). For each strategy, the resulting cumulative dose distribution in a respiratory cycle was determined using a deformable image registration method. RESULTS: There were dosimetric differences between the apparent dose distribution, calculated on a single CT dataset, and the motion-corrected 4D dose distribution, calculated by combining dose distributions delivered to each phase of the 4DCT. The AVE_RIGTV plan using a 1-cm smearing parameter had the best overall target coverage and critical structure sparing. The MIP plan approach resulted in an unnecessarily large treatment volume. The AVE and FB plans using 1-cm smearing did not provide adequate 4D target coverage in all patients. By using a larger smearing value, adequate 4D target coverage could be achieved; however, critical organ doses were increased. CONCLUSION: The AVE_RIGTV approach is an effective strategy for designing proton treatment plans for mobile lung tumors

Since November 1987, 26 patients with resectable gastric cancer were irradiated intraoperatively with the linear accelerator using fast electrons (single dose: 12 to 16 Gy). Percutaneous radiotherapy was performed postoperatively with 24 to 38 Gy (4 x 2 Gy per week). For intraoperative and percutaneous radiotherapy the target absorbed dose was selected in a way that their combined effect on the tumor was approximately equivalent to that of a total dose of 60 Gy in the usual fractionating. Up to now, the median survival time for stage III patients (UICC 1987) has been twelve months. In five patients who died of a relapse or of peritoneal carcinosis, histologic evaluation revealed in every case a diffuse tumor type according to Lauren-classification. All relapses occurred within the first eight months. The two-year survival rate according to Kaplan-Meier is 67% for stage III. Advanced resectable gastric cancer of the intestinal tumor type seems to profit from adjuvant intraoperative radiotherapy. The results warrant further research within the framework of a prospective randomized multicenter study	
1	923	High-dose proton beam radiotherapy of hepatocellular carcinoma: preliminary results of a phase II trial	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Bilirubin/bl [Blood], California, Carcinoma,Hepatocellular/pa [Pathology], Carcinoma,Hepatocellular/rt [Radiotherapy], Cobalt, Disease-Free Survival, Dose Fractionation, Female, Humans, Liver, Liver Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Liver Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Liver Transplantation, Male, Middle Aged, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Injuries, Radiotherapy, Research, Serum Albumin, Survival, Survival Rate	This phase II trial was undertaken to determine the efficacy and toxicity of proton beam radiotherapy for patients with locally unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Cirrhotic patients were eligible if they had a Child-Pugh score of 10 or less. Eligible patients included those with T 1 -T 3 hepatocellular carcinoma; selected T 4 patients also were eligible. Patients with lymph node or distant metastases were ineligible. Daily proton beam radiotherapy was directed to the liver tumor with an additional 1-2 cm margin. The total dose was 63 cobalt Gray equivalents, administered in 15 divided fractions over 3 weeks. Thirty-four patients have completed treatment and have been followed up for a minimum of 6 months, with a median follow-up period of 20 months. The mean age was 65 years, and average tumor size was 5.7 cm. Posttreatment toxicity included a small but significant decline in albumin levels and increased total bilirubin; 3 experienced duodenal or colonic bleeding when bowel was immediately adjacent to the treated tumor. Two-year actuarial data showed a 75% local tumor control rate and an overall survival rate of 55%. Of patients with an elevated pretreatment alpha-fetoprotein, 85% were found to have declining alpha-fetoprotein levels from a pretreatment mean of 1405 to 35 at 6 months after treatment. Six patients underwent liver transplantation between 6 and 16 months after completion of radiotherapy with 2 showing no evidence of residual carcinoma within the explanted liver. Overall the majority of patients responded to treatment, and the therapy was well tolerated

[Russian]	Facility Design and Construction, Humans, Moscow, Particle Accelerators, Protons, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Research, Time	Since 1969 proton beam therapy of patients with different types of diseases using the ITEP synchrotron proton beam with the energy up to 200 MeV has been conducted in a number of Moscow medical centers. These irradiations employing a specially formed beam are used on a routine basis and are performed in parallel with the program of physical research. Two additional channels as well as two new procedure rooms have been in operation since 1982. A special setup of equipment including clinical dosimetry devices, equipment for patients' irradiation (4 special units), and computer-controlled systems have been installed at the facility. By the present time over 1300 patients have been irradiated. The authors describe physical and dosimetric equipment and irradiation techniques. A summary table containing data on the patients is provided

[Review] [390 refs]	Aged, Biopsy,Needle, Brachytherapy, Brachytherapy/mt [Methods], Disease-Free Survival, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Incidence, Male, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Staging, Prostate, Prostate-Specific Antigen, Prostate-Specific Antigen/an [Analysis], Prostatectomy, Prostatic Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Prostatic Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Recurrence, Retrospective Studies, Risk, Risk Assessment, Sensitivity and Specificity, Survival, Survival Analysis, Sweden, Treatment Outcome	A systematic review of radiation therapy trials in prostate cancer has been performed according to principles adopted by the Swedish Council of Technology Assessment in Health Care (SBU). This synthesis of the literature is based on data from one meta-analysis, 30 randomized trials, many dealing with hormonal therapy, 55 prospective trials, and 210 retrospective studies. Totally the studies included 152,614 patients. There is a lack of properly controlled clinical trials in most important aspects of radiation therapy in prostate cancer. The conclusions reached can be summarized as follows: * There are no randomized studies that compare the outcome of surgery (radical prostatectomy) with either external beam radiotherapy or brachytherapy for patients with clinically localized low-risk prostate cancer. However, with the advent of widely accepted prognostic markers for prostate cancer (pre-treatment PSA, Gleason score, and T-stage), such comparisons have been made possible. There is substantial documentation from large single-institutional and multi-institutional series on patients with this disease category (PSA < 10, GS < or = 6, < or = T2b) showing that the outcome of external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy is similar to those of surgery. * There is fairly strong evidence that patients with localized, intermediate risk, and high risk (pre-treatment PSA > or = 10 and/or GS > or = 7 and/or > T2) disease, i.e. patients normally not suited for surgery, benefit from higher than conventional total dose. No overall survival benefit has yet been shown. * Dose escalation to patients with intermediate-risk or high-risk disease can be performed with 3D conformal radiotherapy (photon or proton) boost, with Ir-192 high dose rate brachytherapy boost, or brachytherapy boost with permanent seed implantation. Despite an increased risk of urinary tract and/or rectal side effects, dose-escalated therapy can generally be safely delivered with all three techniques. * There is some evidence that 3D conformal radiotherapy results in reduced late rectal toxicity and acute anal toxicity compared with radiotherapy administered with non-conformal treatment volumes. * There is some evidence that postoperative external beam radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy in patients with pT3 disease prolongs biochemical disease-free survival and that the likelihood of achieving long-term DFS is higher when treatment is given in an adjuvant rather than a salvage setting. A breakpoint seems to exist around a PSA level of 1.0 ng/mL, above which the likelihood for eradication of the recurrence of cancer diminishes. * After prostatectomy, endocrine therapy prior to and during adjuvant radiotherapy may result in longer biochemical disease-free survival than if only adjuvant radiotherapy is given. No impact on overall survival has been shown. * There is fairly strong evidence that short-term endocrine therapy prior to and during radiotherapy results in increased disease-free survival, increased local control, reduced incidence of distant metastases, and reduced cause-specific mortality in patients with locally advanced disease. * There is some evidence that short-term endocrine therapy prior to and during radiotherapy results in increased overall survival in a subset (GS 2-6) of patients with locally advanced disease. * There is strong evidence that adjuvant endocrine treatment after curative radiotherapy results in improved local control, increased freedom from distant metastases, and increased disease-free survival in patients with loco-regionally advanced and/or high-risk disease. * There is moderately strong evidence that adjuvant endocrine treatment after radiotherapy results in longer overall survival compared with radiotherapy alone in patients with loco-regionally advanced disease.

The prognosis of unresectable/metastatic adrenocortical carcinoma remains very poor because the rarity of the tumor has made it difficult to establish treatment guidelines, and diagnosis and the resultant treatment can be greatly delayed. We treated a 24-year-old woman who was diagnosed with adrenocortical carcinoma of the right adrenal gland which extended to the inferior vena cava. Although she underwent surgical resection of the extensive tumor as the primary treatment, the disease recurred in the lung and liver as multiple metastases shortly after surgery. She received intensive multimodality therapy, including chemotherapy with paclitaxel, ifosfamide, and cisplatin (TIP regimen), embolization of the feeding arteries, and proton irradiation for the liver mass. Finally, she underwent reduced-intensity allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from an HLA 1-locus-mismatched sibling donor. A prolonged survival of 39 months after the onset of the disease was achieved. Although this experience is limited, we suggest that TIP chemotherapy was effective for adrenocortical carcinoma, and a graft-versus-tumor effect after reduced-intensity stem cell transplantation may have contributed to the prolonged survival	
0	200	Multiple fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy of residual pituitary macroadenomas: initial experience	Adenoma/pa [Pathology], Adenoma/su [Surgery], Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Middle Aged, Pituitary Gland,Anterior/pa [Pathology], Pituitary Gland,Anterior/su [Surgery], Pituitary Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Pituitary Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Treatment Outcome	OBJECTIVE: We describe our initial experience with fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) for the treatment of 19 patients with secretory and nonsecretory pituitary macroadenomas. The primary endpoints of local control and the documentation of any MRI T2-weighted changes in contiguous brain tissues are discussed. METHODS: Between 1/95 and 1/97, 19 patients were planned with the X-Knife 3-D planning system (Radionics, Burlington, Mass., USA) and received a median dose of 46 Gy in daily 2.0-Gy fractions. Treatments were delivered stereotactically with a dedicated 600SR linear accelerator (Varian Corporation, Palo Alto, Calif., USA). Immobilization was achieved with the Gill-Thomas-Cosman relocatable frame. The mean tumor size was 2.24 cm. The mean prescription isodose was 87%. The mean age was 53 years (10 male, 9 female). The mean follow-up time was 10 months (range 1-24 months). The mean optic chiasm and brain stem doses were calculated at 38 and 13 Gy, respectively. All patients were evaluated with pre- and postgadolinum-enhanced MRI scans and Humphrey visual field tests. RESULTS: In the posttreatment period, local control (absence of tumor progression) has been achieved in all of the patients. The treatment was well tolerated in all patients. No acute complications, no visual changes and no T2-weighted MRI or proton density changes were documented in any of the 19 patients. CONCLUSION: These preliminary results suggest that SRT compares favorably with conventional radiotherapy in achieving local control. The doses to the brainstem and the temporal lobes are significantly decreased and at early follow-up no white matter changes are seen on MRI after SRT. The true frequency of grade 1-4 changes are likely underestimated as similar changes often occur in association with tumor edema or after surgery. Given the uncertain neurocognitive significance of the white matter changes associated with treating these benign tumors by conventional radiotherapy, we are currently treating all pituitary adenomas with fractionated SRT to reduce the potential sequelae

Most uveal melanomas were large, with a mean tumor thickness of 6.5 mm; approximately 60% of the patients had tumors that extended anterior to the equator. A complete follow-up was obtained for all patients. One hundred twelve patients were alive at the time of this report; 18% of the patients developed clinical and laboratory evidence of metastases and eventually died of widespread tumor. Eighty-four percent of eyes were retained. Data were analyzed with a number of parametric and nonparametric techniques. Larger tumors and those located in close proximity to the optic nerve and fovea had a higher incidence of most complications, especially visual loss

DESIGN: Retrospective analysis. SETTING: Massachusetts General Hospital, Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, and Harvard Medical School, Boston. PATIENTS: From 1991 to 2002, 23 patients with newly diagnosed adenoid cystic carcinoma with skull base extension were treated with combined proton and photon radiotherapy. There was tumor involvement of the sphenoid sinus in 61% of patients (14), nasopharynx in 61% (14), clivus in 48% (11), and cavernous sinus in 74% (17). The extent of surgery was biopsy alone in 48% (11), partial resection in 39% (9), and gross total resection with positive margins in 13% (3). The median total dose to the primary site was 75.9 cobalt-gray equivalent. The median follow-up of all surviving patients was 64 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Locoregional control and disease-free survival and overall survival rates. RESULTS: Tumors recurred locally in 2 patients at 33 and 68 months, respectively. No patients developed neck recurrence. Eight patients had distant metastasis as the first site of recurrence. The local control rate at 5 years was 93%. The rate of freedom from distant metastasis at 5 years was 62%. The disease-free and overall survival rates at 5 years were 56% and 77%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, significant adverse factors predictive for overall survival were change in vision at presentation (P = .02) and involvement of sphenoid sinus and clivus (P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: High-dose conformal proton beam radiation therapy results in a very encouraging local control rate in patients with adenoid cystic carcinoma of the skull base. Changes in vision at presentation and tumor involvement of the sphenoid sinus and clivus are important prognostic factors

The average follow-up period was 16 months. One patient developed metastatic disease and died. No eye has been enucleated and tumor regression has been observed in all 22 eyes with a follow-up of more than 12 months. This type of treatment offers definite advantages over previously used methods, can be used for the treatment of relatively large melanomas, and should be considered before enucleation

The cause of failure is almost exclusively local progression of tumor, the remainder is due to complications of treatment. Although this tumor is clearly radiation resistant, there is evidence of a dose response relationship. Using a thin slice CT scan of the entire head of a patient with glioblastoma multiforme, 3-dimensional radiation treatment plans were developed for treatment to a dose of 90 cobalt-Gray-equivalent (CGE). Dose distributions using protons were compared to those using x-rays. The results showed advantages for the proton beam technique. Namely the proton plan irradiated less non-target brain than the x-ray plan; this was especially so in the decrease of coverage of deep-seated structures. The volume of non-target brain that received more than 70 CGE was 175 ml for the x-ray plan and 94 ml for the proton plan. This study indicates that for a subpopulation of patients with glioblastoma multiforme, at least 90 CGE could be delivered with proton beam techniques to the target with only small volumes of normal brain structures receiving more than 70 CGE

Having two treatment ion beams(proton and carbon) and five treatment rooms, it is a pioneer among particle institutes worldwide. In May 2001, proton therapy was started as a clinical study for patients with localized cancer originating in the head and neck, lung, liver, and prostate. The aim of this study was to investigate the safety, effectiveness, and stability of the treatment units and systems based on the evaluation of acute toxicity, tumor response, and working ratio of the machine, respectively. Six patients, including liver cancer in three, prostate cancer in two, and lung cancer in one, were treated. There was no cessation of therapy owing to machine malfunction. Full courses of proton therapy consisting of 154 portals in all six patients were given exactly as scheduled. None of the patients experienced severe acute reactions of more than grade 3 according to NCI-CTC criteria. Tumor response one month post-treatment was evaluable in five of the six patients, and was CR in 1 (prostate cancer), PR in 2 (lung cancer: 1, liver cancer: 1), and NC in 2(liver cancer: 2). These results indicate that our treatment units and systems are safe and reliable enough for proton irradiation to be used for several malignant tumors localized in the body

METHODS: In this noncomparative interventional case series, 40 patients with small melanocytic tumors of the choroid (thickness <3.5 mm) underwent TTT. Follow-up examinations including ophthalmoscopy, ultrasonography, and fundus photography were conducted at 24 to 48 hours, 2 to 6 weeks, and 6-month intervals after treatment. RESULTS: Forty patients (mean age, 58 years) with small melanocytic tumors underwent TTT. Mean follow-up in all patients was 42 months. In most cases TTT resulted in tumor regression. Thirty-one (77.5%) of 40 tumors did not recur after initial treatment with TTT. In 5 (12.5%) of 40 tumors with initial basal diameters ranging from 4 x 2.75 mm to 7.5 x 6 mm and a mean initial thickness of 2.0 mm, edge recurrences developed, which were satisfactorily treated with additional TTT (4 cases) or cryotherapy (1 case). The mean interval between initial TTT and recurrence in this subgroup was 15 months (range, 7-22 months). Of 36 eyes that were successfully treated with TTT or cryotherapy, 26 eyes (72%) had posttreatment visual acuity better than or equal to pretreatment visual acuity. Four (10%) of 40 tumors were not controlled with TTT and eventually required brachytherapy (n = 1), proton radiation (n = 1), or enucleation (n = 2). The initial basal diameters of these tumors ranged from 7.5 x 7.5 mm to 9 x 7.5 mm, with a mean initial thickness of 2.6 mm. The mean interval between treatment and determination of treatment failure was 22 months (range, 7-30 months). CONCLUSIONS: Transpupillary thermotherapy resulted in tumor regression of most small melanocytic choroidal tumors. Tumor edge recurrences were successfully treated with additional TTT in most cases. Four tumors required irradiation or enucleation because of treatment failures with TTT. Transpupillary thermotherapy as a stand-alone therapy is insufficient for some small choroidal melanomas	
0	94	Sacrococcygeal chordomas: potential role of high LET therapy. [Review] [27 refs]	Chordoma/mo [Mortality], Chordoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Linear Energy Transfer, Pelvic Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Pelvic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Sacrococcygeal Region, Survival Rate	Chordomas are rare malignant neoplasms representing less than 3% of all primary bone tumors. They usually have a benign histological appearance and a slow growth rate. Their locoregional progression nearly always causes suffering and eventually death. Efforts to increase local control have included aggressive surgery, radiation therapy or combined approaches but locally free survival rates remain relatively low and have not exceeded 30% at 5 years. Sacrococcygeal chordomas, which represent approximately 50% of the localizations, have been investigated less frequently than those at the base of the skull or cervical region with primary or post-operative radiation therapy. The disappointing results with photon therapy in a multimodality approach and the good results reported by Schoenthaler with charged particles in the Lawrence Berkeley laboratory led us to propose fast neutron therapy in the management of inoperable or recurrent sacrococcygeal chordomas. Preliminary results obtained from only 12 patients indicate that high linear energy transfer (LET) therapy seems to be a good alternative for radical treatment of chordomas in the case of microscopic or macroscopic residual tumor.

Doses to the whole liver ranged from 10 to 24 Gray-equivalent (the biological equivalent of 10 to 24 Gray of low-LET photon radiation), whereas the dose to the primary lesion ranged from 53.5 to 70 Gray-equivalent (GyE). The fraction size was 2 to 3 GyE. The liver received partial as well as whole organ irradiation. Integral dose volume histograms for the liver were obtained in all 11 patients. An integral dose volume histogram displays on the ordinate the percentage of liver that was irradiated in excess of the dose specified on the abcissa. In this study, the clinical liver radiation tolerance of these patients is correlated with the information contained in an integral dose volume histogram. One patient developed radiation hepatitis. The integral dose volume histogram of this patient differed from the dose volume histograms of the other 10 patients. This difference was greatest in the range of doses between 30 and 40 GyE. Our results suggest that liver doses in excess of 30 to 35 GyE should be limited to 30% of the liver or less when 18 GyE of whole liver radiation is delivered at 2 GyE per fraction in addition to primary radiation of the pancreas or biliary system

Thirty-four tumors were included in the experimental groups, of which twenty-three were irradiated and eleven served as controls. Tumors were irradiated with protons produced at the 160 megavolts Harvard cyclotron. The dose delivered to the tumor ranged from 7.5 to 27.5 proton gray in a single treatment, and 25.0 proton gray delivered in two fractions separated by 24 hours. Reduction of tumor growth was significantly greater than controls (p less than 0.001) with treatment doses greater than or equal to 17.5 proton gray. Histologic examination revealed a marked decrease of mitotic activity in all specimens examined 48 hours after treatment at these higher doses. Total regression without evidence of remaining malignant cells was noted in three tumors treated at 17.5 proton gray or above. Our results indicate that human retinoblastoma in a murine host, with a tumor mass similar to that seen in a clinical setting, is sensitive to radiation by high energy protons	
0	1521	In vivo determination of extra-target doses received from serial tomotherapy.[see comment]	Gonads/re [Radiation Effects], Head, Head and Neck Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Luminescence, Particle Accelerators, Probability, Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Radiation Oncology, Radiometry, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Risk, Sternum/re [Radiation Effects]	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to perform in-vivo measurements of extracranial doses received by patients undergoing serial tomotherapy of the head and neck. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Intensity modulated radiotherapy treatment (IMRT) plans were designed for nine patients using the CORVUS treatment planning system (NOMOS Corp.). These plans were delivered using a tertiary collimator dedicated for serial tomotherapy attached to a 10-MV linear accelerator. For each patient, one optically stimulated luminescence dosimeter (OSLD) was placed on the sternum and one on the lower abdomen. The OSLDs were then processed, thereby estimating the in vivo absorbed doses to the sternum and gonads as a function of distance from the treatment site. RESULTS: The OSLDs were shown to measure known doses to within 5%, thereby validating their accuracy for this dose and energy range. In the patient studies, the dose received by the OSLDs varied in direct proportion to the number of monitor units delivered and inversely with the distance from the target volume; the patient dose at a distance of 15 cm from the target is approximately 0.4% of the total monitor units delivered, and drops to below 0.1% of the total MUs at approximately 40 cm from the center of the target. The average sternal dose was 1353 mSv and the average abdominal dose was 327 mSv for an average prescribed dose of 60.1 Gy. This can be attributed, at least partially, to the inefficient treatment delivery that on average required 9.9 MU/0.01 Gy. CONCLUSIONS: While IMRT reduces the normal tissue volume in the high-dose region, it also increases the overall monitor units delivered, and hence the whole-body dose, when compared with conventional treatment delivery. As has been noted in existing literature, these increases in whole-body dose from radiotherapy delivery may increase the likelihood of a radiation-induced secondary malignancy. Therefore, it is important to assess the risk of secondary malignancies from IMRT delivery, and compare this relative risk against the potential benefits of decreased normal tissue complication probabilities

Proton beams and stereotactic conformal radiotherapy (SCRT) can be used to tailor the dose to nonspherical targets, as most tumors of the brain are irregularly shaped. Comparative planning of brain lesions using either proton or stereotactically guided photon beams was done to assess the institution's clinically available modality for three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: For the photon treatment, multiple stereotactically guided uniform intensity beams from a linear accelerator were used, each conformed to a projection of the planning target volume (PTV) by a mMLC. Proton beams were delivered from an isocentrically mounted gantry, using the spot-scanning technique and energy modulation. Seven patients were scanned in a stereotactic frame; target volumes and organs at risk (OAR) were delineated with the help of MR images. Four different lesions were selected: (1) concave, (2) ellipsoid isolated, (3) superficial and close to an organ at risk, and (4) irregular complex. Dose distributions in the PTV and critical structures were calculated using three-dimensional treatment-planning systems, followed by both a quantitative (by dose--volume histogram and conformity index) and qualitative (visual inspection) assessment of the plans. RESULTS: A high degree of conformation was achieved with a mMLC and stereotactic uniform intensity beams with comparable conformity indices to protons for 5 out of 7 plans, especially for superficial or spherical lesions. In the cases studied, the conformity index was better for protons than for photons for complex or concave lesions, or when the PTV was in the neighborhood of critical structures. CONCLUSION: The results for the cases studied, show that for simple geometries or for superficial lesions, there is no advantage in using protons. However, for complex PTV shapes, or when the PTV is in the vicinity of critical structures, protons seem to be potentially better than the fixed-field photon technique

Thirteen patients had carcinomas and three had sarcomas. All patients had complete pelvic surgery including extrafascial (or modified radical) hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, pelvic node sampling, evaluation of peritoneal cytology, and resection of extrauterine metastases when indicated. All patients were free of gross visible tumor after surgery. Target doses of radiation were 3000 cGy to the upper abdomen and 4500 cGy to the pelvis. Median follow-up was 24 months for survivors (range, 17 to 63 months). The disease-free survival and overall survival at 17 months was 50%. Six of the 16 (38%) patients suffered intraabdominal relapse. One patient had a significant complication (bowel perforation). The data from this pilot study suggest that whole abdominal-pelvic irradiation may be useful only in the management of some patients with few high risk features of endometrial carcinoma. Patients with extensive extra-uterine involvement and with sarcoma histology do not appear to benefit from this experimental therapy

Methods and initial results of dynamic pion therapy in phase II studies	Bile Duct Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Cystectomy, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Kidney Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Mesons, Methods, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Pancreatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Particle Accelerators, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/ae [Adverse Effects], Research, Time, Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	Negative pi-meson (pion) therapy employing dynamic scanning with a focused spot of convergent beams has been in use since 1981 at SIN. Three-dimensional conformation of the treatment volume to the target volume can thus be achieved. Following previously reported Phase I and Ib clinical trials, a Phase II trial was initiated with the goal of treating primary deep-seated tumors in a dose optimization schedule which included stepwise increase of total pion dose and of target volume. Patients with multicentric superficial bladder tumors who were cystectomy candidates were initially selected. Since then, more invasive cases have been treated. A graded scoring of acute tissue reactions was employed. Follow-up periods were from 10 to 20 months. The pion dose escalation ranged from 3000 rad (minimum) to 3600 rad (minimum) in 20 fractions over 5 weeks. The treatment volumes encompassed 190 cc for local to 1,820 cc for extended volume therapy. Treatment reactions ranged from a faint erythema and increase of bladder frequency to dry desquamation, mild nausea, moderate dysuria, and moderate proctitis or diarrhea with mucus. These reactions were closely related to treatment volume and site. One severe late cystitis has occurred in a patient treated with 2 courses of pions (4475 rad). Mild to moderate late proctitis has been seen in 4 patients. Ten of 13 bladder cancer patients had local control of disease while all 3 pancreas or biliary tract cancer patients had microscopic residual disease locally at time of death from metastasis. A total of 11 of 17 patients are thus clinically or pathologically free of local tumor to time of last observation	
1	374	A technique of partial breast irradiation utilizing proton beam radiotherapy: comparison with conformal x-ray therapy.[see comment]	Breast, Breast Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Breast/re [Radiation Effects], Dose Fractionation, Female, Heart, Humans, Immobilization, Immobilization/is [Instrumentation], Prone Position, Protons, Radiation Injuries/pc [Prevention & Control], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Conformal, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research, Skin/re [Radiation Effects], Treatment Outcome, Vacuum, X-Rays	PURPOSE: To develop a breast immobilization system and clinical technique to deliver partial breast irradiation with a proton beam and compare dose distributions using proton therapy and conformal x-rays. METHODS: A clinical technique to provide reproducible breast immobilization was developed. Breast immobilization begins by fitting each patient with a treatment brassiere. Patients are placed prone in a cylindrical polyvinyl chloride shell with the upper and lower body being supported and immobilized with Vac-Lok foam bead cushions. The upper chest and breast areas are immobilized with two-part expandable foam. After a treatment planning computed tomography scan, the lumpectomy cavity is outlined, and a clinical target volume is generated by adding 1cm in all dimensions. A three-dimensional treatment plan is developed with treatment typically given with 2 to 4 separate proton beams. The dose administered is 40 cobalt Gray equivalents (CGE) delivered in 10 daily fractions of 4 CGE with multiple fields treated each day. Proton and conformal x-ray plans were compared using dose-volume histogram analysis to determine volumes of normal breast tissue and skin treated with each technique. RESULTS: An institutional review board-approved clinical trial was developed using this technique, and 20 patients have completed treatment. All subjects were able to undergo the immobilization procedure and daily treatments without significant discomfort, and no treatment interruptions were encountered. There was no evidence of respiratory motion identified on treatment planning CT images or on daily set-up radiographs. Acute toxicity has been limited to occasional radiation dermatitis (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group grade 1-2). Proton plans were compared with 2 methods of photon partial breast irradiation, including reduced tangential fields and five-field conformal techniques. Ten treatment plans with dose-volume histogram analysis revealed that the use of proton beams provided a significant reduction in doses to the ipsilateral breast and skin while eliminating doses to the heart and lung tissues. CONCLUSIONS: A simple immobilization procedure provides accurate and reproducible breast positioning while simultaneously eliminating respiratory motion. The procedure has been well tolerated by the first 20 patients. Protons can provide substantial normal tissue protection compared with the use of conformal x-rays when used for partial breast treatment. We plan to continue enrollment and analyze long-term toxicity, local control, and survival	
0	3973	Recurrent hyperthyroidism in an acromegalic patient previously treated with proton beam irradiation: Graves' disease as probable etiology based on follow-up observations	Acromegaly/bl [Blood], Acromegaly/co [Complications], Acromegaly/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Follow-Up Studies, Graves Disease/bl [Blood], Graves Disease/co [Complications], Graves Disease/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Hyperthyroidism/bl [Blood], Hyperthyroidism/et [Etiology], Hyperthyroidism/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Pituitary Irradiation, Thyrotropin-Releasing Hormone/pd [Pharmacology], Thyrotropin/bl [Blood], Thyroxine/bl [Blood], Time, Triiodothyronine/bl [Blood]	A 56-year-old woman presented in 1973 with hyperthyroidism and partial anterior pituitary insufficiency. Three years before she had undergone pituitary irradiation for acromegaly and hyperthyroidism, the latter was attributed at the time to excessive TSH secretion because of elevations in plasma TSH. During the present 11/2 years of observation, TSH levels were appropriately low and did not respond to iv TRH when the patient was hyperthyroid. Moreover, they did not rise during treatment, even as the patient became borderline hypothyroid. It is concluded that hyperthyroidism probably has always been due to Graves' disease

[French]	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Brachytherapy, Brachytherapy/ae [Adverse Effects], Brachytherapy/mt [Methods], Eye Enucleation, Female, France, Humans, Iodine Radioisotopes/du [Diagnostic Use], Lead, Liver Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Male, Melanoma, Melanoma/pa [Pathology], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Optic Nerve, Radiation, Radioisotopes, Retinal Diseases/et [Etiology], Retrospective Studies, Time, Treatment Outcome, Uveal Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Visual Acuity	PURPOSE: Iodine 125 curietherapy is one of the conservative treatments of uveal melanoma. The technique used to achieve these results was simplified through the physical characteristics of the radioelement and the optimized-dosimetry program employed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 78 patients with choroidal melanoma were treated with iodine 125. About 100 Gy were delivered to the superior pole of the tumour. The minimal length of follow-up was 17 months and the average, 67 months. RESULTS: There was 88% local control, leading to lowered visual acuity in 76% of the cases. Radiation retinopathy, directly related to proximity to the macula, is the principle etiology. Seven patients died of hepatic metastasis, five patients were enucleated. Four patients were further treated with protontherapy to make up for noncontrol locally. CONCLUSION: One dose of 100 Gy to the superior pole of the tumor seemed to lead to good local control, with the exception of complications related to proximity to the macula and the optic nerve. In this attempt to optimize irradiation, the time lapse between any benefit in local control derived from irradiation and posttherapeutic complications observed remains insufficient to evaluate any relationship	
1	4744	Proton radiotherapy as an alternative to exenteration in the management of extended conjunctival melanoma	Adolescent, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Brachytherapy, Conjunctival Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Conjunctival Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Dose Fractionation, Eye, Eye Enucleation, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Germany, Humans, Male, Melanoma, Melanoma/pa [Pathology], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Methods, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Invasiveness, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/rt [Radiotherapy], Patients, Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Recurrence, Retrospective Studies, Time, Treatment Outcome, Universities, Visual Acuity	BACKGROUND: Diffuse and multifocal patterns of conjunctival melanoma may not be treatable with standard eye-sparing methods. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of proton beam radiation therapy as an alternative to exenteration. METHODS: Twenty patients with extended conjunctival melanoma were treated by proton beam irradiation. Most cases were T3 tumours which were not accessible to brachytherapy due to their extension, localisation with fornical or caruncular involvement. Only 2 patients had a tumour limited to the bulbar conjunctiva. Both were recurrent tumours with multiple lesions. Sixteen cases were recurrences after various pre-treatments. The area of the conjunctiva which was suspected to have microscopic disease was treated by 31 Gy in 6 fractions. The "high risk" areas with a clinically detectable tumour (primary target volume) were treated by an additional boost using a smaller beam size and applying 2 fractions up to 45 Gy. An individually shaped compensator was brought into the beam to modify the range of the protons so that the eye was irradiated only at a depth of 2 mm. RESULTS: The mean follow-up time was 38.1+/-26.6 months (median 34 months). Recurrent disease occurred in 6 cases (30%); 2 of them outside the irradiated volume, 3 within the target volume treated by 31 Gy, and just one in the primary target volume treated by 45 Gy. An exenteration followed only in two patients (10%). 6 patients (30%) suffered from metastatic disease and 4 (20%) of them have died by now. During follow up we found no statistically significant association between the occurrence of local recurrence after proton radiotherapy and the development of metastases. Best corrected visual acuity remained stable in 12 cases (60%); in 14 patients the best corrected visual acuity was 0.25 or better. A sicca-syndrome developed in 19/20 patients. However, only 10/20 patients used artificial tears more than 5x/d. A focal cataract developed in 7 patients (35%). There was eyelash loss in the area of irradiated eyelids. In 4 cases a limbal stem cell deficiency occurred with the consequence of corneal vascularisation. CONCLUSIONS: Proton radiotherapy may serve as an alternative to exenteration in case of T3 and diffuse T1 or T2 conjunctival melanomas

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1981 and 1988, 15 patients with craniopharyngioma were treated in part or entirely with fractionated 160 MeV proton beam therapy. The group consisted of 5 children (median age, 15.9 years) and 10 adults (median age, 36.2 years). Median dose prescribed to the tumor was 56.9 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE; 1 proton Gray = 1.1 CGE). The median proton component was 26.9 CGE. Patients were treated after documented recurrence after initial surgery (n = 6) or after subtotal resection or biopsy (n = 9). None had had prior radiation therapy. RESULTS: Median observation period of surviving patients (n = 11) was 13.1 years from radiotherapy. One patient was lost to follow-up with tumor control after 5.2 years. Actuarial 10-year survival rate was 72%. Four patients have died 5-9.1 years after treatment, two from local failure. Actuarial 5- and 10-year local control rates were 93% and 85%, respectively. The functional status of the living adult patients is unaltered from their preradiotherapy status; all of them continued leading normal or near normal working lives. None of the patients treated as a child had experienced recurrence of tumor. One child shows learning difficulties and slight retardation, comparable to his preradiotherapy status. The others have professional achievements within the normal range. CONCLUSION: Results in terms of survival and local control are comparable with other contemporary series. Although no formal neuropsychological testing was performed, the surrogate measures of lifestyle and professional accomplishments appear to be satisfactory

OBJECTIVE: To examine a large clinical series of patients with intraocular melanoma to determine if light irises are associated with increased risk of death from these tumors. METHODS: A total of 1162 patients treated with proton irradiation between 1984 and 1996 were observed through 1997. RESULTS: Iris color in the patients was blue or gray in 48%, green or hazel in 30%, and brown in 23%. Tumors in patients with blue or gray irises were less heavily pigmented (P<.001) and closer to the optic disc and macula (P<.001). Five- and 10-year metastasis-related death rates were 0.14 and 0.21, respectively, for those with blue or gray irises and 0.10 and 0.15, respectively, for those with darker irises (P = .02). In a Cox proportional hazards regression controlling for tumor characteristics, patients with blue or gray irises died of metastatic disease at a rate 1.90 times (95% confidence interval, 1.26-2.85) that of patients with brown irises. The rate of metastatic death was not significantly elevated for those with green or hazel irises (relative risk, 1.43; 95% confidence interval, 0.91-2.23). CONCLUSION: Patients with blue or gray irises appear to be at increased risk of metastatic death from choroidal melanoma, independent of other risk factors

[Russian]	Aged, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Physics, Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Radiation, Radiation Injuries, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy	The proton beam of the 157 MeV synchrotron of the Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Physics was modified for irradiation of prostatic cancer patients. Patient's topometric preparation and method of transperineal irradiation were described. A method of radiotherapy with proton beam boost was applied to 17 patients with different clinical stages of disease. After 6-20 months of the follow-up all the patients have been alive without clinical signs of tumor. In most of the patients radiation reactions of the critical organs were regarded as mild ones. Chronic and long-term radiation injuries were not detected in the patients who lived over 1 year

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1999 and 2003, 37 patients were treated in our institution. The indications for PBT were pathologically proven NSCLC, clinical Stage I, tumor size < or =5 cm, medically inoperable or refusal of surgery, and written informed consent. A total dose of 70-94 Gy(E) was delivered in 20 fractions (3.5-4.9 Gy(E) per fraction). RESULTS: Patient characteristics (number of patients) were as follows: Stage IA/IB, 17 of 20; medically inoperable/refusal of surgery, 23/14; total dose 70/80/88/94 Gy(E), 3/17/16/1. With a median follow-up period of 24 months, the 2-year local progression-free and overall survival rates were 80% and 84%, respectively. The 2-year locoregional relapse-free survival rates in Stage IA and Stage IB were 79% and 60%, respectively. No serious acute toxicity was observed. Late Grades 2 and 3 pulmonary toxicities were observed in 3 patients each. Of these 6 patients, 5 had Stage IB disease. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy is a promising treatment modality for Stage I NSCLC, though locoregional relapse and late pulmonary toxicities in Stage IB patients were substantial. Further investigation of PBT for Stage I NSCLC is warranted

Gamma-ray radiation was used for comparison. The results of standard colony formation assay showed that the survival fraction of each cell line decreased in an LET-dependent manner. The results of other direct cytotoxic assays, dye exclusion test, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay, also displayed a similar relationship between the cytotoxic effect of carbon beams and LET. The maximum values of the cell death index (CDI) were 50.2% in A172 and 37.5% in TK1, both obtained on day 7 after exposure to carbon beams of 80 keV/microm. Apoptosis was observed only on days 4 and 7 after carbon beam irradiation, with maximum values of 7% in A172 and 4.5% in TK1, and the induction of apoptosis after high-LET radiation could be p53-independent. This indicated that a combination of multiple assays to detect cell death was important in evaluating the radiosensitivity of tumor cells, because this approach could more precisely reflect the clinical effectiveness of radiotherapy

The time between start of helium ion treatment and recognition of metastatic disease ranged from 3 to 67 months (median, 27 months). The mean pretreatment tumor height in the patients with metastases was 7.7 mm. All 42 patients who developed metastatic disease have died. The median survival after diagnosis of metastatic disease was 5 months; the longest survival was 49 months. The most common site of metastasis was the liver (n = 34). Four (10%) of the 42 patients with metastases also had local recurrence of the tumor. Multivariate analysis identified three variables that predicted independently the development of metastases and lack of survival. These variables are anterior location of tumor (P = .027), tumor height greater than 5 mm (P = .02), and tumor diameter greater than 10 mm (P = .0075)

These tumors are believed to behave more aggressively than chordomas in adults and may have unusual morphology. This study examines a large series of pediatric skull base chordomas treated with a standardized protocol to characterize the behavior and morphology of these tumors. There were 31 males and 42 females ranging from 1 to 18 (mean 9.7) years. Forty-two cases (58%) were conventional chordomas, some of which had unusual histopathologic features. Chondroid chordomas comprised 23% of cases. Fourteen tumors (19%) were highly cellular and had a solid growth pattern with no myxoid matrix or lobular architecture. Eight of these had cytologic features of conventional chordoma cells including physaliferous cells (cellular chordoma). The remaining cellular tumors were composed of poorly differentiated epithelioid cells set in a fibrous stroma and lacked physaliferous cells (poorly differentiated chordoma). All variants studied by immunohistochemistry showed positive staining for cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen, S100 protein, and vimentin. Mitoses and necrosis were seen in all variants. Follow-up data were available for all patients and ranged from 1 to 21 (mean 7.25) years. The survival rate was 81%. All but 1 patient with poorly differentiated chordoma died of disease. Overall, base of skull chordomas in children and adolescents treated with proton beam radiation have better survival than chordomas in adults. However, poorly differentiated chordomas are highly aggressive tumors

However, the survival of severe cirrhotic patients has recently improved due to advanced treatments. The aim of this study was to define the role of proton beam therapy for HCC patients with severe cirrhosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 19 HCC patients with Child-Pugh class C cirrhosis received proton beam therapy. The hepatic tumors were solitary in 14 patients and multiple in five, and the tumor size was 25-80 mm (median 40 mm) in maximum diameter. No patient had regional lymph node or distant metastasis. Total doses of 50-84 Gy (median 72 Gy) in ten to 24 fractions (median 16) were delivered to the tumors. RESULTS: Of the 19 patients, six, eight and four died of cancer, liver failure and intercurrent diseases, respectively, during the follow-up period of 3-63 months (median 17 months) after treatment. A remaining patient was alive with no evidence of disease 33 months after treatment. All but one of irradiated tumors were controlled during the follow-up period. Ten patients had new intrahepatic tumors outside the irradiated volume. The overall and progression-free survival rates were 53% and 47% at 1 year, respectively, and 42% each at 2 years. Performance status and Child-Pugh score were significant prognostic factors for survival. Therapy-related toxicity of grade 3 or more was not observed. CONCLUSION: Proton beam therapy for HCC patients with severe cirrhosis was tolerable. It may improve survival for patients with relatively good general condition and liver function

The extent of skin involvement and presence of lymphadenopathy were seen to be important prognostic factors. The following survival patterns were observed. In eight cases with limited plaque disease there was prolonged disease-free survival after treatment with kilovoltage X-rays; after a median follow-up of 64 months there was only one case of progression to generalized disease. In 49 cases of generalized skin disease (plaque disease +/- tumours; erythroderma) treated with total skin electron beam therapy there was a 24% 5-year disease-free survival; this potential for long-term survival was seen in cases with generalized plaque disease without lymphadenopathy. The remainder of the cases showed a continuously relapsing course. The extent of skin involvement and presence of lymphadenopathy can both be used as known prognostic factors to adopt a logical plan of treatment

Because of their deep location, local infiltrative nature, and involvement of surrounding bone, treatment of chordoma is a challenge. The authors analyze the data and prognostic factors obtained during the follow-up period (range 1-150 months, median 38 months) in 53 patients with craniocervical junction chordoma and 10 patients with chondrosarcoma. METHODS: Several surgical approaches were used, and some tumor excisions required staged procedures. Survival was calculated according the Kaplan-Meier method. Statistical analysis was performed using the Fisher exact and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Radical/subtotal resection was achieved in 77.8% of the patients. The mortality rate during the follow-up period was 14.3%. In patients harboring chondrosarcoma better 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates were demonstrated than in those with chordoma (100% and 50.7%, respectively). Histological patterns (typical or chondroid chordoma) and patient age at onset of symptoms had no effect on the RFS rates. Radical/subtotal resections were associated with better RFS rates than partial resection. Adjuvant proton-beam radiotherapy was shown to increase the RFS rates compared with conventional radiotherapy (90.9% and 19.4%, respectively at 4 years posttreatment). Karyotypically abnormal tumors were associated with worst RFS rates as compared with karyotypically normal lesions (44.5% and 90.3%, respectively at 3 years). Cases of cranial nerve palsy, followed by CSF leakages were the most frequent postoperative complication. Permanent postoperative neurological deficit was observed in 28.6% of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: A better prognosis was observed in patients with chondrosarcoma compared with those harboring chordoma. Histological pattern and the patient's age at symptom onset were not factors that influenced prognosis in cases of chordoma. Extensive resection and possibly adjuvant proton-beam radiotherapy provided better prognosis for these patients

Eleven patients were initially treated with x-ray at doses of 16.2-50.4 (mean 42.5) Gy, followed by proton beam at doses of 30.0-52.9 (mean 37.6) Gy. The other four patients were treated with proton beams alone at total doses of 75.0-88.5 (mean 81.4) Gy. The mean total dose for the 15 patients was 80.4 Gy. As a result, the primary tumor lesions of all 15 patients disappeared and complete responses were obtained. Approximately four to five months later, nine of the 15 patients developed esophageal ulcer formations at the circumferences of their primary lesions. The ulcerations were healed, however, by conservative management. There was no evidence of local recurrence throughout the observations on six cases of superficial carcinoma. Among nine advanced carcinoma patients, three relapsed into esophageal carcinoma. Recurrences were observed eight, 16 and 44 months, respectively, after the treatment. Ten of the 15 patients died, but eight died of other diseases. Three of four cases at autopsy did not show any cancer cells in irradiated primary lesions. Four of the 15 patients lived for over five years. The results suggest that a high dose of irradiation delivered by a well-defined proton field could result in improved local control and long-term survival in esophageal carcinoma without undue risk of injury to primary and adjacent organs

DESIGN: Retrospective analysis. SETTING: Massachusetts General Hospital, Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, and Harvard Medical School, Boston. PATIENTS: From 1991 to 2002, 23 patients with newly diagnosed adenoid cystic carcinoma with skull base extension were treated with combined proton and photon radiotherapy. There was tumor involvement of the sphenoid sinus in 61% of patients (14), nasopharynx in 61% (14), clivus in 48% (11), and cavernous sinus in 74% (17). The extent of surgery was biopsy alone in 48% (11), partial resection in 39% (9), and gross total resection with positive margins in 13% (3). The median total dose to the primary site was 75.9 cobalt-gray equivalent. The median follow-up of all surviving patients was 64 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Locoregional control and disease-free survival and overall survival rates. RESULTS: Tumors recurred locally in 2 patients at 33 and 68 months, respectively. No patients developed neck recurrence. Eight patients had distant metastasis as the first site of recurrence. The local control rate at 5 years was 93%. The rate of freedom from distant metastasis at 5 years was 62%. The disease-free and overall survival rates at 5 years were 56% and 77%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, significant adverse factors predictive for overall survival were change in vision at presentation (P = .02) and involvement of sphenoid sinus and clivus (P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: High-dose conformal proton beam radiation therapy results in a very encouraging local control rate in patients with adenoid cystic carcinoma of the skull base. Changes in vision at presentation and tumor involvement of the sphenoid sinus and clivus are important prognostic factors

METHODS: Four patients with unresectable solitary hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma underwent 55-82 Gy proton-beam irradiation for a period of 15-47 days. Follow-up CT including plain, enhanced and dynamic imaging was performed for a period of 9-36 months. RESULTS: Good preservation of arterial blood supply while gradual decrease in tumour size was clearly depicted by dynamic CT. CONCLUSION: We believe that preservation of hypervascularity as judged by enhancement at CT and magnetic resonance imaging, does not necessarily mean that radiotherapy in hypervascular malignant tumours has been unsuccessful

The initial 30 patients were treated with proton beams; the subsequent 810 patients were treated with helium ion beams. In the great majority of the 475 patients treated for pituitary tumors, marked and sustained biochemical and clinical improvement was observed. Variable degrees of hypopituitarism developed in about one-third of patients treated solely with radiosurgery. In the earlier years of the program, 365 patients underwent radiosurgery to treat selected systemic diseases by inducing hypopituitarism. Focal temporal lobe necrosis and cranial nerve injury occurred in about 1% of patients who were treated with doses less than 230 Gy

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1999 and 2003, 37 patients were treated in our institution. The indications for PBT were pathologically proven NSCLC, clinical Stage I, tumor size < or =5 cm, medically inoperable or refusal of surgery, and written informed consent. A total dose of 70-94 Gy(E) was delivered in 20 fractions (3.5-4.9 Gy(E) per fraction). RESULTS: Patient characteristics (number of patients) were as follows: Stage IA/IB, 17 of 20; medically inoperable/refusal of surgery, 23/14; total dose 70/80/88/94 Gy(E), 3/17/16/1. With a median follow-up period of 24 months, the 2-year local progression-free and overall survival rates were 80% and 84%, respectively. The 2-year locoregional relapse-free survival rates in Stage IA and Stage IB were 79% and 60%, respectively. No serious acute toxicity was observed. Late Grades 2 and 3 pulmonary toxicities were observed in 3 patients each. Of these 6 patients, 5 had Stage IB disease. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy is a promising treatment modality for Stage I NSCLC, though locoregional relapse and late pulmonary toxicities in Stage IB patients were substantial. Further investigation of PBT for Stage I NSCLC is warranted

Series patients uniformly refused enucleation both at an outside institution and again as a treatment option after extensive discussion at the University of California, San Francisco. DESIGN: In a retrospective, nonrandomized cohort study, 21 patients with extra-large choroidal or ciliochoroidal melanomas measuring at least 10 mm in maximum thickness or 20 mm in maximum basal diameter or tumors located within 3 mm of the optic nerve measuring at least 8 mm in maximum thickness or 16 mm in maximum basal diameter met inclusion criteria. Main outcome measures were frequency of (1) anterior segment complications (lash loss, keratopathy, cataract, and neovascular glaucoma), (2) posterior segment complications (vitreous hemorrhage, radiation retinopathy, and radiation papillopathy), (3) treatment failure (tumor growth, enucleation, or metastases), and (4) final visual acuity. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 28 months. Mean age at treatment was 58.3 years. The frequencies of hypertension and diabetes mellitus were 14.3% and 9.5%, respectively. Mean tumor thickness and mean basal diameter were 8.6 mm and 18.7 mm, respectively. Lash loss occurred in 52.4%; dry eye, in 23.8%; cataract, in 28.6%; neovascular glaucoma, in 38.1% (100% in patients with diabetes mellitus); radiation retinopathy, in 9.5%; and radiation papillopathy, in 9.5%. No patient developed radiation-associated scleral necrosis or vitreous hemorrhage. The 2-year Kaplan-Meier estimate of local tumor growth after treatment was 33%, and the rate of distant metastasis was 10%. Visual acuity of 20/200 or better was preserved in 25% of patients, including 4 patients (19%) who experienced an average of 4 lines of Snellen visual acuity improvement. Development of neovascular glaucoma was associated with tumors in close proximity to the optic nerve (P = .04), while cataract (P = .03) and lash loss (P = .02) occurred with more anteriorly located tumors. Proton beam radiotherapy provided a 67% probability of local control and 90% probability of clinically discernible metastases-free survival at 24 months after treatment. CONCLUSION: Proton beam radiotherapy is an ocular-conserving option that may be considered for the treatment of extra-large uveal melanoma in carefully selected patients	
1	4655	Cumulative incidence of radiation-induced cavernomas in long-term survivors of medulloblastoma	Adolescent, Adult, Cerebellar Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Child, Child,Preschool, Cranial Irradiation, Cranial Irradiation/ae [Adverse Effects], Female, Frontal Lobe, Hemangioma,Cavernous/ep [Epidemiology], Hemangioma,Cavernous/et [Etiology], Humans, Incidence, Israel, Male, Medulloblastoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Methods, Patients, Photons, Protons, Radiation, Radiation Injuries, Retrospective Studies, Survivors, Time, Treatment Outcome	OBJECT: The goal of this study was to determine the incidence of radiation-induced cavernomas in children treated for medulloblastoma. METHODS: A retrospective chart and film review was performed for all patients treated for medulloblastoma at the Insitute for Neurology and Neurosurgery/Beth Israel Medical Center between August 1996 and the present. The clinical and radiographic histories of pediatric patients (ages 3-21 years at diagnosis) with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of medulloblastoma who received craniospinal radiation therapy were reviewed. Fifty-nine patients were identified, with a mean age at radiation treatment of 7.7 years and a mean follow-up time of 7.2 years. The dose to the craniospinal axis was 24 Gy (31 patients) or 36 Gy (28 patients). The radiation energy in the craniospinal axis was provided by photons in 55 patients and protons in four. All patients received a posterior fossa boost of 54 Gy (46 patients) or 72 Gy (13 patients). Twenty-six lesions developed in 18 patients (31%) during the observation period. The cumulative incidence of lesion development was 5.6, 14, and 43%, at 3, 5, and 10 years, respectively. The sites of occurrence were cerebral (20 cases) and cerebellar (six cases). There was no significant correlation between age at diagnosis, sex, craniospinal radiation dose or energy source, and lesion development. Only one patient required surgical intervention for a symptomatic hemorrhagic lesion in the frontal lobe. Histological analysis in this case was consistent with cavernoma. CONCLUSIONS: Cavernomas are common after cranial irradiation in children, and their incidence increases over time. Most of these lesions follow a benign course and do not require intervention

The authors followed 946 patients with melanomas of the choroid and/or ciliary body who had been treated with proton beam irradiation and who had provided a smoking history during their evaluation before treatment. After a mean follow-up of 33 months, 98 patients were diagnosed with metastatic disease. Metastasis-free survival rates 3 years after irradiation were similar in association with never, past, and current cigarette smoking (86%, 89%, and 90%, respectively; P = 0.90). Rates also were similar with increasing pack-years of exposure and when the product smoked was cigarettes versus pipes or cigars only. Estimates for smoking effects were unchanged after adjusting for established prognostic factors for metastases. Results suggest that smoking does not alter the risk of metastases during the first few years after irradiation of choroidal melanomas

METHODS: Nine ependymoma patients have been treated with SRS (four with linear accelerator and five with Gamma Knife) since 1990. Two patients had WHO grade III tumors, and the remaining seven had WHO grade II tumors. Eight of nine patients received external beam radiation therapy at some point prior to radiosurgery to a total median dose of 54 Gy. The radiosurgery dose ranged from 14 to 20 Gy. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 28 months. The median age of patients at diagnosis was 35 years. Four patients developed progressive disease following radiosurgery, and two patients have died of progressive disease. The 3-year relapse-free survival was 55.6%. The 3-year overall survival was 71.1%. Patients treated with radiosurgery as a component of initial treatment (generally as a boost following external beam) had an improved relapse-free survival (100%) compared to those treated with radiosurgery to salvage an external beam local failure (20%). CONCLUSION: SRS is an effective treatment for intracranial ependymoma. Further clinical trials are warranted incorporating radiosurgery as a component of initial management in selected ependymoma patients

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Two optical displacement sensors, placed close to the patient's head, were used for online monitoring of the head position, with submillimeter accuracy. Motion data, including the difference between start and end position (Dx) and the maximum displacement during the recorded session (Dx-max), were acquired for pretreatment sessions to analyze alignment radiographs, and for treatment sessions. We have recorded 102 pretreatment and 99 treatment sessions in 16 patients immobilized with a thermoplastic mask, and 44 pretreatment and 56 treatment sessions in 13 patients immobilized with vacuum-assisted dental fixation. To avoid incorrect data analysis due to replicate observations, only 1 pretreatment and 1 treatment session per patient were selected at random for statistical comparison of mean or median motion parameters in different subgroups. RESULTS: Both techniques showed similar immobilization efficiencies. The median Dx and Dx-max values were 0. 18 mm and 0.46 mm, respectively, for 16 treatment sessions with mask immobilization, and 0.22 mm and 0.50 mm, respectively, for 13 treatment sessions with dental immobilization. Motion parameters for pretreatment and treatment sessions were not statistically different. CONCLUSION: Online verification of patient's head motion is feasible and provides valuable data for confirmation of proper treatment delivery in individual patients, as well as for the evaluation of different immobilization methods

A patient with Hodgkin's disease has been chosen as an example and has been planned with different radiation treatment modalities using photons and protons. The ICRP calculation scheme has been used to calculate mortality from dose distributions. To this purpose target volumes as well as critical structures have been outlined in the CT set of a patient with Hodgkin's disease. Dose distributions have been calculated using conventional as well as intensity modulated treatment techniques using photon and proton radiation. From the mean doses of each organ the mortality has been derived. Our work suggests that calculations of mortality can be useful in comparative treatment planning. Such mortality calculations can be helpful to find decisions between radiotherapy treatment techniques (intensity modulated or conventional treatment) or between different types of radiation (photons, electrons, protons, neutrons)

Preliminary results	Aged, Angiography, Choroid Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Choroid Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Epithelium, Evaluation Studies as Topic, Female, Fluorescein Angiography, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Melanoma, Melanoma/mo [Mortality], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Particle Accelerators, Phosphorus, Prognosis, Radiation Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Research, Television, Time, Ultrasonography	Choroidal malignant melanomas in nine patients were treated with proton beam irradiation at the Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory, Cambridge, Mass. Each patient received five proton beam treatments in eight to ten days, totalling 4,730 to 8,570 rads at the tumor. No complications occurred during the treatment or follow-up period, which, at the time of this writing, ranges from one to 24 months, with an average of 12 months. No further growth of the tumor has been observed in any patient. Different signs of tumor regression have been noted. Resolution of the serous retinal detachments that accompanied some tumors is the earliest finding. Pigment changes over the surface of the tumor and adjacent pigment epithelium is a usual initial tumor response. Fluorescein angiography initially showed decreased leakage of dye; later, destruction of the tumor's vasculature and elimination of fluorescein leakage became evident. Only large choroidal vessels remained patient. Ultrasonography revealed decreased height of the tumors postirradiation, and the radioactive phosphorus (32P) uptake test, repeated in one patient, turned negative on postirradiation measurements

METHODS AND MATERIALS: This is a prospective study utilizing three common cranial irradiation techniques. Technique A uses a half-beam, nondivergent radiation field. Technique B has the anterior divergent field edge at the lateral bony canthus. Technique C is similar to B, but with a field collimator angle. Thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) lens dose measurements were obtained in children and phantom with all three techniques. RESULTS: Seventeen children were studied. Lens dose measurements were obtained in 14 children with technique A using MLC and blocks. In 7 of 14 children, dose measurements were obtained with MLC only. One child was treated with technique B and 2 children were treated with C, with MLC +/- blocks. In all 3 techniques, with MLC alone, the lens dose increased by 64%, 119%, and 72%, respectively. Similar results were obtained in phantom. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that independent of irradiation technique, additional custom blocking is required to maximally protect the lens with MLC shaped fields. This is due to the lack of conformity between MLC and the desired field edge at the lateral bony canthus

They received total doses of 51-99.2 Gy in fractions of 2-12.5 Gy. All of the tumours responded well to the treatment. All four lesions of Bowen's disease, three of the five oral verrucous carcinomas, and the three squamous cell carcinomas completely regressed following irradiation. Two squamous cell carcinomas recurred during the follow-up period. One recurrent squamous cell carcinoma was successfully treated by a salvage surgical operation, and in the other case the patient refused further therapy. In two verrucous carcinomas there was 90% regression of tumour volume. No severe radiation-related complication occurred. As proton radiotherapy produces good local tumour control without significant morbidity to the surrounding normal tissues, it may prove to be a useful therapeutic modality for the treatment of skin carcinomas

CASE: A 28 year old white male sought help because of a conjunctival swelling. A biopsy made elsewhere had revealed a capillary haemangioma of the conjunctiva. Recently striking alterations of the skin led to the suspicion of a Kaposi's sarcoma. Immunohistochemical and dermatological examinations confirmed the diagnosis of a Kaposi's sarcoma and viral testing of serum revealed an HIV-infection. Besides intensive antiviral therapy, our patient underwent local irradiation of the right eye, the nose and of the left shoulder with an external beam. CONCLUSIONS: Kaposi's sarcoma is the most frequent Aids-associated malignant tumor. In about 30% of all patients with Aids, a Kaposi's sarcoma is diagnosed. The angiomatous character may lead to the histopathological diagnosis of a haemangioma.Human herpes virus 8 is known to be the transforming element

However, the survival of severe cirrhotic patients has recently improved due to advanced treatments. The aim of this study was to define the role of proton beam therapy for HCC patients with severe cirrhosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 19 HCC patients with Child-Pugh class C cirrhosis received proton beam therapy. The hepatic tumors were solitary in 14 patients and multiple in five, and the tumor size was 25-80 mm (median 40 mm) in maximum diameter. No patient had regional lymph node or distant metastasis. Total doses of 50-84 Gy (median 72 Gy) in ten to 24 fractions (median 16) were delivered to the tumors. RESULTS: Of the 19 patients, six, eight and four died of cancer, liver failure and intercurrent diseases, respectively, during the follow-up period of 3-63 months (median 17 months) after treatment. A remaining patient was alive with no evidence of disease 33 months after treatment. All but one of irradiated tumors were controlled during the follow-up period. Ten patients had new intrahepatic tumors outside the irradiated volume. The overall and progression-free survival rates were 53% and 47% at 1 year, respectively, and 42% each at 2 years. Performance status and Child-Pugh score were significant prognostic factors for survival. Therapy-related toxicity of grade 3 or more was not observed. CONCLUSION: Proton beam therapy for HCC patients with severe cirrhosis was tolerable. It may improve survival for patients with relatively good general condition and liver function

[German]	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Child, Cobalt, Female, Head, Humans, Male, Meningeal Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Meningeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Meningioma/mo [Mortality], Meningioma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/ae [Adverse Effects], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Retrospective Studies, Survival, Time, Time Factors, Treatment Outcome	PURPOSE: Most malignant meningiomas will recur following surgical resection only. The role of irradiation and radiation dose levels is poorly defined. This study reviews a single institution experience using both, conventional and high doses > or = 60 Gy/CGE radiation regimen. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1974 and 1995 16 patients with histologically proven malignant meningioma underwent radiation therapy (RT). Age at diagnosis ranged between 6 and 79 years (median: 49 years). Three patients reported previous irradiation to the head at least 14 years prior to diagnosis. Ten patients were treated for primary, and 6 patients for recurrent disease. Six patients underwent gross total and 10 patients subtotal resection (Table 1). RT was delivered using conventional, megavoltage photons or combined 160 MeV proton and photon irradiation. Except 1 patient, who died during RT, the radiation doses ranged between 40 and 70 Gy/CGE (= Cobalt Gray Equivalent) (median: 58 Gy/CGE, Table 2). RESULTS: With median observation time of 59 months (range: 10 to 155 months), actuarial local control rates at 5 and 8 years were 52% and 17%, respectively. Target doses > or = Gy/CGE resulted in significantly improved tumor control (100%) compared to < 60 Gy/CGE (17%) (p = 0.0006, Table 3 and Figure 1). Improved local control translated also in increased overall survival: 87% (> or = 60 Gy/CGE) versus 15% (< 60 Gy/CGE) at 5 years (p = 0.025, Figure 2). At time of analysis, 6/16 patients (38%) were alive. Two patients developed symptomatic brain damage at doses of 59.3 and 72 Gy/CGE. CONCLUSION: Conformal, radiation therapy with target doses > or = 60 Gy/CGE, in this study by use of combined proton and photon irradiation, can significantly improve chances of long-term local control and survival for patients diagnosed with these challenging tumors

The results of computerized tomography in 2 planes (axial and frontal) were used for planning. Manual tumor reconstruction with subsequent dose planning was done on direct and lateral telecraniograms. The procedure was tested in 25 patients.

Short-term effects at 2 months following treatment were studied in a further three patients. MRI abnormalities were observed in nine patients. No statistically significant differences between patients and controls (n = 17) were seen in any of the calculated 1H-MRS metabolite ratios, in any of the three patient groups. On multivariate logistic regression analysis there was a correlation between the choline/water ratio and a low IQ. It is concluded that any systematic radiation-induced changes in the 1H MRS metabolites must be below the detection threshold of this study

Proton irradiation of ocular melanoma requires an accurate assessment of all tumour margins. The tumour is marked surgically by suturing to the sclera four or five tantalum rings on the borders of the tumour defined by transillumination. In order to evaluate the clinical usefulness of high-frequency ultrasound imaging, four and five rings were surgically placed in a patient with an iris/ciliary body melanoma and in a patient with ciliochoroidal melanoma using transillumination to localize the tumour margins. Subsequently margins were verified by HFUI. In the first patient, the distances between the rings and the limbus were measured using calipers during surgery and were compared with HFUI measurements and measurements from planning software. The distances were comparable within 0.5 mm. In the second patient the treatment was planned in two different ways using EYEPLAN software. In the first scenario the shape of the tumour and its relation to the rings were obtained from the surgeon's mapping, the fundus drawing using a transilluminating point light source, and the HFUI. In the second scenario, the shape of the tumour was deduced from the ring positions only. It was observed that the maximum difference between the tumour edge as seen on high-frequency ultrasound images and the rings was 2.6 mm. The tumour volume was underestimated by 39% when tumour shape was obtained from ring positions only. During the past year we have utilized HFUI in 18 patients having tumours involving the anterior segment of the eye, among which four were treated with proton therapy. In conclusion, we believe that high-frequency ultrasound imaging provides additional information with respect to the location of tumour margins in ciliary body and anterior uveal melanoma. Occult extension of the tumour within the ciliary body or posterior iris may not be appreciated by transillumination alone

This study was to analyze the initial response rate of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and the influence of different treatment modalities on prognosis. METHODS: From January 1996 to December 2002, the clinical data of 129 patients with previously untreated nasal NHL were retrospectively reviewed with all lesions confirmed by pathology. 116 patients were morphologically diagnosed as having nasal NK/T cell lymphoma. The immunophenotype was available in 57 cases and 52 (91.2%) of them were confirmed as NK/T-cell lymphoma. According to the Ann Arbor Staging System, 102 patients had stage I(E), 22 stage II(E), and 5 stage IV(E) disease. Among the 124 patients with stage I(E) and II(E) diseases, 22 patients received radiotherapy alone, 7 chemotherapy alone, and 95 combined modality therapy (CMT). Of these 95 patients treated with CMT, 45 patients were treated with radiotherapy followed by chemotherapy, and 50 with chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy. The primary treatment for stage IV(E) patients was chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy to the primary tumor. RESULTS: The overall 5-year survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS) for all patients was 68.0% and 55.8%, respectively. It was 71.7% and 60.9% for stage I(E), and 70.6% and 47.0% for stage II(E), respectively (P > 0.05). The OS and DFS at the 5th year were 83.1% and 68.0% for patients who achieved complete response (CR), and 18.0% and 15.5% for those who did not, respectively (P = 0.000). Of the 124 patients with stage I(E) and II(E) disease, 67 patients were treated with radiotherapy alone (22 patients) or radiotherapy followed by chemotherapy (45), whereas 57 were treated with chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy (50) or chemotherapy alone (7). The CR rate after radiotherapy was 74.7%, however, it was only 19.3% after chemotherapy (P = 0.000). Of the 46 patients with PR, SD or PD after chemotherapy, 42 still had locoreginally localized lesion and 31 of these patients achieved CR by following radiotherapy which revealed satisfactory results. For stage I(E) and II(E) disease, the 5-year OS and DFS were 76.0% and 65.0% for radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy, and 74.4% and 56.2% for chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy. The difference was statistically not significant. However, 7 stage I(E) and II(E) patients were treated with chemotherapy alone, and 4 of them died of disease progression, with 1-year survival of 26.7%. CONCLUSION: The majority of Chinese patients with primary nasal NHL are NK/T cell in origin. The complete response rate by radiotherapy is much higher than that by chemotherapy. The addition of chemotherapy to radiotherapy did not improve the survival of patients with early stage nasal lymphoma. Radiotherapy is suggested as the primary treatment for stage I(E) and II(E) nasal NK/T cell lymphoma

The patient characteristics were no different from those noted in previous studies. Patients were treated either with 60Co teletherapy units or 4 MeV linear accelerators with different daily (180-225) and weekly (4 times vs. 5 times) fractionation schemes. A recurrent-free survival was attained in 80% of the patients 2 years after primary treatment with radiation therapy. There were 27 local recurrences, of which 82% were salvaged with surgery for an overall adjusted survival of 95%. Patients treated on 60Co units with field sizes less than or equal to 30 sq. cm had a 15% increase in local recurrence compared with field size greater than 30 sq. cm, which could not be attributed to lower doses. Poorly differentiated tumors and those involving the anterior commissure were more likely to develop a local recurrence. Doses above 1900 ret were associated with a decrease in local recurrence in patients having anterior commissure involvement. Salvage with limited surgery for failure was effective in selected cases

Thirty-two patients were studied, 12 of whom underwent brachytherapy with 106Ru plaques and 20 of whom were treated with accelerated protons. After a follow-up period of 12 months, the following was observed: reduction of the thickness of the tumor (significantly greater in the tumors which underwent brachytherapy) and morphological and structural changes which consisted in a thinning of the tumor and an increased reflectivity

A total of 39 evaluable patients were treated with curative intent using either fast neutrons alone or in combination with low LET irradiation as part of a mixed beam fractionation scheme. Actuarial survival curves are presented for both the "neutrons alone" and the "mixed beam" treatment groups. There was no significant survival difference between these groups of patients. The projected survival at two years is less than 10%, which is comparable with megavoltage photon results for an unselected series of patients. The size of the primary lesion and the initial Karnofsky performance status were found to be the most important prognostic indications for prolonged survival. Sixteen of 39 patients were felt to have achieved local clearance of their tumor at some time during their follow-up with the median time until a local recurrence being 17 months. Treatment related complications and patterns of metastatic spread are discussed. In general, it appeared that the response of large tumors to neutron irradiation resulted in necrosis and fistula formation. In many cases this was accompanied by persistent/recurrent tumor within the high dose radiation volume

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Volumetric cine computed tomography (CT) images were obtained on 7 lung cancer patients under free-breathing conditions with a 256-multislice CT scanner. Cardiac phase was determined by selecting systole and diastole. A WEL difference image (DeltaWEL) was calculated by subtracting the WEL image at end-systole from that at end-diastole at respiratory exhalation phase. Two calculation regions were defined: Region 1 was limited to the volume defined by planes bounding the heart; Region 2 included the entire body thickness for a given beam's-eye-view angle. RESULTS: The DeltaWEL values observed in Region 1 showed fluctuations at the periphery of the heart that varied from 20.4 (SD, 5.2) mm WEL to -15.6 (3.2) mm WEL. The areas over which these range perturbation values were observed were 36.8 (32.4) mm(2) and 6.0 (2.8) mm(2) for positive and negative WEL, respectively. The WEL fluctuations in Region 2 increased by approximately 3-4 mm WEL, whereas negative WEL fluctuations changed by approximately -4 to -5 mm WEL, compared with WEL for Region 1; areas over 20 mm WEL changes in Region 2 increased by 9 mm(2) for positive DeltaWEL and 2 mm(2) for negative DeltaWEL. CONCLUSIONS: Cine CT with a 256-multislice CT scanner captures both volumetric cardiac and respiratory motion with a temporal resolution sufficient to estimate range fluctuations by these motions. This information can be used to assess the range perturbations that charged particle beams may experience in irradiation of lung or esophageal tumors adjacent to the heart

Gross total resection with negative margins is rarely achieved, and the risks of functional, structural, and cosmetic deficits limit the radiation dose using conventional radiation techniques. Twenty-nine children and adolescents treated with conformal proton radiotherapy (proton RT) were analyzed to assess treatment efficacy and safety. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between July 1992 and April 1999, 29 patients with mesenchymal tumors underwent fractionated proton (13 patients) or fractionated combined proton and photon (16 patients) irradiation. The age at treatment ranged from 1 to 19 years (median 12); 14 patients were male and 15 female. Tumors were grouped as malignant or benign. Twenty patients had malignant histologic findings, including chordoma (n = 10), chondrosarcoma (n = 3), rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 4), and other sarcomas (n = 3). Target doses ranged between 50.4 and 78.6 Gy/cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE), delivered at doses of 1.8-2.0 Gy/CGE per fraction. The benign histologic findings included giant cell tumors (n = 6), angiofibromas (n = 2), and chondroblastoma (n = 1). RT doses for this group ranged from 45.0 to 71.8 Gy/CGE. Despite maximal surgical resection, 28 (97%) of 29 patients had gross disease at the time of proton RT. Follow-up after proton RT ranged from 13 to 92 months (mean 40). RESULTS: Of the 20 patients with malignant tumors, 5 (25%) had local failure; 1 patient had failure in the surgical access route and 3 patients developed distant metastases. Seven patients had died of progressive disease at the time of analysis. Local tumor control was maintained in 6 (60%) of 10 patients with chordoma, 3 (100%) of 3 with chondrosarcoma, 4 (100%) of 4 with rhabdomyosarcoma, and 2 (66%) of 3 with other sarcomas. The actuarial 5-year local control and overall survival rate was 72% and 56%, respectively, and the overall survival of the males was significantly superior to that of the female patients (p = 0.002). Of the patients with benign tumors, 1 patient (giant cell tumor) had local failure at 10 months. The other 8 patients continued to have local tumor control; all 9 patients were alive at last follow-up (actuarial 5-year local control and overall survival rate of 89% and 100%, respectively). Severe late effects (motor weakness and sensory deficits) were observed in 2 (7%) of 29 patients. CONCLUSION: Proton RT for children with aggressively recurring tumors after major skull base surgery can offer a considerable prospect of tumor control and survival. Longer follow-up is necessary to assess the real value of protons, in particular with regard to bone growth and cosmetic outcome	
1	2363	The effectiveness of immobilization during prostate irradiation	Adenocarcinoma, Adenocarcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Immobilization, Male, Methods, Particle Accelerators, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiation, Radiation Injuries/pc [Prevention & Control], Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted/is [Instrumentation], Rectum, Research, Time, Universities	PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of a hemibody foam cradle on the reproducibility of patient setup during external beam radiation treatment of prostate cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between January 1992 and April 1993, 74 patients received external beam radiation treatment to the prostate +/- nodes, generally with a four-field box technique. Forty-four of the 74 patients had a custom-made hemibody foam cast used in an attempt to improve setup accuracy. A review of the routine weekly port films was performed following the completion of therapy to determine the reproducibility of patient setup in all 74 patients. The physician's request of an isocenter shift was used as an indicator of reproducibility. Neither the treating technologists nor the physicians knew at the time the films were taken that the port films would be reviewed for setup reproducibility at a later date. The results were compared between the patients treated with (44) and without (30) an immobilization device. RESULTS: In the 44 immobilized patients, 213 routine checks of the isocenter were performed during the 7-week course of radiation therapy. In 17.4% of these instances (37 out of 213), an isocenter shift was requested. This rate is compared to 23.1% (30 out of 130) in the 30 patients who did not have the immobilization device (p < 0.2). There was a statistically significant reduction in isocenter shifts requested in the anterior to posterior direction in the patients who were immobilized, 5.1% (9 out of 175) vs. 12.6% (13 out of 103) (p < 0.05, two tailed chi-square test). There was no significant improvement in the reproducibility of isocenter placement in the cephalad to caudal or right to left directions. CONCLUSIONS: This custom-made hemibody foam cradle appears to improve the reproducibility of patient setup during the 7-week course of fractionated external beam irradiation for patients with adenocarcinoma of the prostate. This type of immobilization device is now routinely used in our clinic and is recommended for all patients receiving pelvic radiotherapy. These devices are likely to be particularly useful when contemplating dose escalation to minimize the volume of bladder and rectum included in the treatment fields

We have made it a rule to do field localization by X-ray pictures before each treatment. For this purpose we have developed a localize-verify system consisting of a fluoroscopic unit and a real time digital image processing device. By using this system as well as X-ray films, field placement errors or corrected distance at field localization were measured in 11 patients with esophageal cancers. Measurements of corrected distances on a total of 177 localization attempts disclosed that correction by > 5 mm was necessary in 30.6% and by > 10 mm in 10.2% of all localization attempts. Corrected distances appeared to increase with age, possibly because the skin becomes looser and ambulatory status tends to be more limited in older patients. Field placement corrections of more than 5 mm were required in 66.7% of 60 localizations in patients > 80 years old. Two patients in whom the anatomical positions of the esophagus were easily movable are presented. The following common characteristics of these patients were considered high risk factors: they were more than 80 years old; lesions were located in the lower esophagus; and they had T1 tumors. These findings suggested that frequent positioning and verification of treatment fields are necessary in the accurate treatment of esophageal cancers, especially those in high-risk patients	
1	2060	Changes in the liver parenchyma after proton beam radiotherapy: evaluation with MR imaging	Adult, Aged, Female, Humans, Japan, Liver, Liver Diseases/di [Diagnosis], Liver Diseases/pa [Pathology], Liver Diseases/rt [Radiotherapy], Liver/pa [Pathology], Liver/re [Radiation Effects], Magnetic Resonance Imaging/mt [Methods], Male, Middle Aged, Protons, Radiotherapy, Time, Universities	The objective of this study was to describe magnetic resonance (MR) findings with a 1.5T imager for hepatic parenchymal changes after proton beam radiotherapy. Thirty-two patients who received proton radiotherapy with doses of 50-87 Gy underwent MR imaging 1-75 months (mean 22 months) after the start of irradiation. Axial T(2), T(1)-weighted imaging, and a dynamic study after a gadolinium injection were performed. The irradiated areas showed hypointense in T(1)-weighted images, hyperintense in T(2)-weighted images, and intense and prolonged enhancement on the dynamic study (maximum relative enhancement 441.8%+/-263.3 vs. surrounding liver 145.6%+/-67.7, p<0.0001). T(2) values of the irradiated areas were 50.6 to 65.8 msec greater than in the surrounding liver (p<0.005). The values increased with time, being significantly greater 13 months or longer after the beginning of the therapy than after a period of less than 3 months (p<0.05). Pathologic examinations (n = 3) indicated that the irradiated areas were composed of collapsed lobules with hepatic small vein occlusions, and rich extracellular matrices which retained extracellular fluid. MR imaging can demonstrate hepatic parenchymal changes after proton beam radiotherapy, and show the changes are irreversible

The purpose of this study was to use proton MR spectroscopy to investigate serial changes in recurrent malignant gliomas after gamma knife radiosurgery to characterize tissue response to high-dose radiation. METHODS: Eighteen patients with recurrent gliomas were studied with MR imaging and 3D proton MR spectroscopic imaging at the time of radiosurgery and at regular time points thereafter. Choline (Cho) and N-acetyl aspartate levels were calculated on a voxel-by-voxel basis and compared with levels found in normal tissue and with levels observed at previous time points. The results of the spectral analysis were then compared with the radiologic findings. Statistical comparisons were precluded by the small sample sizes involved. RESULTS: Response within the gamma knife target was observed as a reduction of Cho levels and an increase in lactate/lipid levels, typically within 6 months of treatment. Increases in Cho correlated with poor radiologic response and suggested tumor recurrence, confirmed histologically in six cases. The development of a spectral abnormality preceded a coincident increase in contrast enhancement by 1 to 2 months in nine cases. CONCLUSION: Proton MR spectroscopic imaging provided diagnostic and monitoring information before and after radiosurgery. Evaluation of metabolic changes with proton MR spectroscopy and structural changes with MR imaging improved tissue discrimination and provided correlation with histologic findings	
0	1585	Pedicled rhinotomy for clival chordomas invaginating the brainstem	Adult, California, Chordoma/pa [Pathology], Chordoma/su [Surgery], Cranial Fossa,Posterior, Dura Mater/pa [Pathology], Dura Mater/su [Surgery], Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Nasal Cavity/su [Surgery], Neoplasm Invasiveness, Nose, Radiotherapy, Retrospective Studies, Rotation, Skull Base Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Skull Base Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Treatment Outcome	OBJECT: Clival chordomas are frequently midline lesions whose posterior growth may breach the dura and invaginate the brainstem. This precludes safe delivery of potentially curative high-dose fractionated proton radiotherapy. To avoid this problem, the authors performed pedicled rhinotomy to resect chordomas in 10 patients. METHODS: Pedicled rhinotomy is a midface transnasal route to the intercarotid sella and clivus from the tuberculum sellae to the mid-C-2 level. It involves a lateral rhinotomy incision, osteotomies of nasal bones and cartilage, lateral rotation of the nose, removal of the nasal septum and medial maxillary walls, opening of ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses, and dissection of nasopharynx and oropharynx to expose the clivus and craniovertebral junction. Tumors involving the sella, medial cavernous sinuses, middle and lower clivus, and C-1 arch and dens can be removed even if they traverse the dura. Closure involves dural repair, grafting of fat and split-thickness skin, rotation of a vascularized mucosal pedicle, and reattachment of nasal cartilage. Ten clival chordomas in adult patients were surgically removed via a pedicled rhinotomy approach. Seven patients had previously undergone a total of nine skull base procedures. In eight of the 10 patients, tumors compressing the brainstem were completely removed using this technique. One patient required an additional subtemporal resection of a suprasellar tumor before definitive radiotherapy could be undertaken. No patient sustained any new neurological deficit; in eight patients headache, diplopia, or hemiparesis improved. One patient developed postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leakage and meningitis that were successfully treated with antibiotic agents and shunt placement. CONCLUSIONS: Pedicled rhinotomy provides excellent shallow-field exposure of midline clival chordomas and permits relief of brainstem compression and the postoperative administration of potentially curative proton beam irradiation

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four hydrogen-1 MR spectroscopic imaging studies were performed in a patient with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) before, during, and after radiation therapy and at follow-up at 33 months after diagnosis of the recurrence of disease. The patient had a single, large lesion in the brain and underwent hyperfractionated radiation therapy for 4 weeks. A series of MR images was also obtained. RESULTS: The pretreatment study showed a lesion with a distinct spectral pattern: marked elevation of choline and lipids and great reduction of creatine and N-acetylaspartate. During and after treatment, H-1 MR spectroscopic images depicted a progressive reduction of the abnormal choline and lipid signals. Thirty-three months after treatment, multiple-section H-1 MR spectroscopic images showed normal spectral patterns in all sections examined. CONCLUSION: H-1 MR spectroscopy may contribute to the neuroradiologic evaluation of NHL and, in particular, may be useful in monitoring therapeutic response	
0	401	Histological study of choroidal malignant melanoma treated by carbon ion radiotherapy	Aged, Carbon, Choroid Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Choroid Neoplasms/ri [Radionuclide Imaging], Choroid Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Eye Enucleation, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Melanoma/pa [Pathology], Melanoma/ri [Radionuclide Imaging], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Necrosis, Positron-Emission Tomography, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy	PURPOSE: To report, we believe for the first time, a histological study of choroidal malignant melanoma treated by carbon ion beam radiotherapy. METHODS: A 75-year-old Japanese man was diagnosed as having a choroidal melanoma after undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Positron emission tomography (PET) revealed a hot spot in the same location as the intraocular mass seen in MRI. Carbon ion radiotherapy was performed with a total dose of 77 Gy, and the hot spot seen by PET disappeared completely. At 15 months after carbon ion therapy, the eye had to be enucleated because of uncontrollable ocular hypertension. It was examined histologically in serial sections. RESULTS: A large tumor mass (15 x 12 mm) with high pigmentation was found in the vitreous space. Almost all tumor cells showed necrosis in every section. A small number of intact tumor cells were present at the periphery. The overlying retina did not show any necrosis, but showed mild to moderate gliosis. No intraretinal hemorrhage, lipid deposit, or protein exudate was apparent. CONCLUSIONS: Almost all tumor cells showed necrosis after radiotherapy with a carbon ion beam. However, the effect on the adjacent tissues was determined as minimal in histological analysis	
1	1487	Proton beam stereotactic radiosurgery of vestibular schwannomas	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Hearing, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Middle Aged, Neuroma,Acoustic/pa [Pathology], Neuroma,Acoustic/su [Surgery], Patient Satisfaction, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Time	PURPOSE: The proton beam's Bragg peak permits highly conformal radiation of skull base tumors. This study, prompted by reports of transient (30% each) and permanent (10% each) facial and trigeminal neuropathy after stereotactic radiosurgery of vestibular schwannomas with marginal doses of 16-20 Gy, assessed whether proton beam radiosurgery using a marginal dose of only 12 Gy could control vestibular schwannomas while causing less neuropathy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Sixty-eight patients (mean age 67 years) were treated between 1992 and 1998. The mean tumor volume was 2.49 cm(3). The dose to the tumor margin (70% isodose line) was 12 Gy. The prospectively specified follow-up consisted of neurologic evaluation and MRI at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months. RESULTS: After a mean clinical follow-up of 44 months and imaging follow-up of 34 months in 64 patients, 35 tumors (54.7%) were smaller and 25 (39.1%) were unchanged (tumor control rate 94%; actuarial control rate 94% at 2 years and 84% at 5 years). Three tumors enlarged: one shrank after repeated radiosurgery, one remained enlarged at the time of unrelated death, and one had not been imaged for 4 years in a patient who remained asymptomatic at last follow-up. Intratumoral hemorrhage into one stable tumor required craniotomy that proved successful. Thus, 97% of tumors required no additional treatment. Three patients (4.7%) underwent shunting for hydrocephalus evident as increased ataxia. Of 6 patients with functional hearing ipsilaterally, 1 improved, 1 was unchanged, and 4 progressively lost hearing. Cranial neuropathies were infrequent: persistent facial hypesthesia (2 new, 1 exacerbated; 4.7%); intermittent facial paresthesias (5 new, 1 exacerbated; 9.4%); persistent facial weakness (2 new, 1 exacerbated; 4.7%) requiring oculoplasty; transient partial facial weakness (5 new, 1 exacerbated; 9.4%), and synkinesis (5 new, 1 exacerbated; 9.4%). CONCLUSION: Proton beam stereotactic radiosurgery of vestibular schwannomas at the doses used in this study controls tumor growth with relatively few complications	
1	142	Temporal lobe (TL) damage following surgery and high-dose photon and proton irradiation in 96 patients affected by chordomas and chondrosarcomas of the base of the skull	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Child, Chondrosarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Chondrosarcoma/su [Surgery], Chordoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Chordoma/su [Surgery], Combined Modality Therapy, Female, Humans, Incidence, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/rt [Radiotherapy], Photons/ae [Adverse Effects], Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Prospective Studies, Protons, Protons/ae [Adverse Effects], Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation Injuries/et [Etiology], Radiation Injuries/pa [Pathology], Radiotherapy Dosage, Skull Base Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Skull Base Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Temporal Lobe/re [Radiation Effects]	PURPOSE: To determine the temporal lobe (TL) damage rate in 96 patients treated with high-dose proton and photon irradiation for chordomas and chondrosarcomas of the base of the skull. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The records of 96 consecutive patients treated at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory (HCL) between June 1984 and 1993, for chordomas and chondrosarcomas of the base of the skull were reviewed. All the patients had undergone some degree of resection of the tumor prior to radiation therapy. Seventy-five patients were classified as "primary tumors" and 21 as recurrent or regrowing tumors after one or more surgical procedures. All the patients were randomized to receive 66.6 or 72 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE) on a prospective dose-searching study by proton and photon irradiation (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group #85-26) with conventional fractionation (1.8 CGE/day, 5 fractions/week). All treatments were planned using the three-dimensional (3D) planning system developed at the Massachusetts General Hospital, and the dose was delivered using opposed lateral fields for the photon component and a noncoplanar isocentric technique for the proton component. Clinical symptoms of TL damage were classified into 4 grades. Computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were evaluated for white matter changes. Abnormalities associated with persistent or recurrent tumor were distinguished from radiation-induced changes. TLs were delineated on the original scans of the 10 patients with damage and those of a group of 33 patients with no clinical or MRI evidence of injury. Dose distributions were calculated and dose-volume histograms were obtained for these patients. RESULTS: Of the patients, 10 developed TL damage, with bilateral injury in 2 and unilateral injury in 8. The cumulative TL damage incidence at 2 and 5 years was 7.6 and 13.2%, respectively. The MRI areas suggestive of TL damage were always separated from the tumor bed. Symptoms were severe to moderate in 8 patients. Several baseline factors, tumor- or host-related, were analyzed to evaluate their predictivity for TL damage: age, gender, tumor site, histology, type of presentation, type and number of surgical procedures, primary tumor volume, prescribed dose, normal tissue involvement, and volume of TL receiving doses ranging between 10 and 50 CGE or more. Only gender, in a univariate analysis (log rank) was a significant predictor of damage (0.0155), with male patients being at significantly higher risk of TL injury. In a stepwise Cox regression that included gender as a variable, no other baseline variable improved the prediction of damage. CONCLUSIONS: The 2- and 5-year cumulative TL damage rates were 7.6 and 13.2%, respectively. Despite the different TL damage rates related to age, tumor volume, number of surgical procedures prior to radiation therapy, and prescribed doses to the tumor, only gender was a significant predictor of damage (p = 0.0155) using a univariate (log rank) test. Chordomas and chondrosarcomas of the base of the skull may represent an interesting model to evaluate the TL damage rates because of their extradural origin, displacing the white matter instead of infiltrating it as gliomas do, because of their longer local recurrence-free survival other than gliomas and other brain tumors and because of the high doses of irradiation delivered to the target volume to obtain local control	
0	72	Ultrasonographic and angiographic follow-up of primary choroidal malignant melanoma after proton beam irradiation therapy	Aged, Aged,80 and over, Choroid Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Choroid Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Choroid Neoplasms/us [Ultrasonography], Coloring Agents/du [Diagnostic Use], Fluorescein Angiography, Follow-Up Studies, Fundus Oculi, Humans, Image Enhancement, Indocyanine Green/du [Diagnostic Use], Melanoma/pa [Pathology], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Melanoma/us [Ultrasonography], Middle Aged, Mitosis, Protons, Reproducibility of Results, Video Recording	The aim of this study is to evaluate the reliability of the ultrasonographic and angiographic follow-up of primary choroidal malignant melanoma (PCMM) after proton beam irradiation therapy in a series of 14 patients. All patients underwent standardized A and B scan ultrasonography, fluorescein and indocyanine green videoangiography (FV, ICGV) before and after treatment with proton beam irradiation. The follow-up was carried out at 1, 3, 5, 8 months and then every 6 months. The mean follow-up was 26 months (range 6-46 months). The thickness of the tumors was demonstrated to be decreased and the internal reflectivity to be enhanced in 12 out of 14 cases from 8 months after treatment till the end of the follow-up period. In 2 eyes which were enucleated 5 months after treatment, histopathology confirmed that medium-low internal reflectivity corresponded to several areas of high cellularity and cellular mitosis. FV and ICGV were impossible because of opacities of dioptric media in 2 cases. From 8 months after treatment till the end of the follow-up period, in all the examined patients, FV demonstrated large hypofluorescent zones of the lesions which represented the destruction of the vascular tree of the tumor. From 8 months after treatment till the end of the follow-up period, ICGV demonstrated hypofluorescence of the lesions in 8 cases; mild hyperfluorescence and zones of colorant staining were present in late angiograms in 2 cases. The results of our study seem to confirm the reliability of standardized A and B scan ultrasonography in the follow-up of PCMM treated with proton beam irradiation; if ultrasonography is used together with FV and ICGV, the reliability of this combination is surely higher	
0	339	Patient study of in vivo verification of beam delivery and range, using positron emission tomography and computed tomography imaging after proton therapy	Algorithms, Feasibility Studies, Humans, Image Interpretation,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Massachusetts, Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Positron-Emission Tomography/mt [Methods], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation Oncology, Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Reproducibility of Results, Research, Scattering,Radiation, Sensitivity and Specificity, Subtraction Technique, Tomography,X-Ray Computed/mt [Methods]	PURPOSE: To investigate the feasibility and value of positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET/CT) for treatment verification after proton radiotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: This study included 9 patients with tumors in the cranial base, spine, orbit, and eye. Total doses of 1.8-3 GyE and 10 GyE (for an ocular melanoma) per fraction were delivered in 1 or 2 fields. Imaging was performed with a commercial PET/CT scanner for 30 min, starting within 20 min after treatment. The same treatment immobilization device was used during imaging for all but 2 patients. Measured PET/CT images were coregistered to the planning CT and compared with the corresponding PET expectation, obtained from CT-based Monte Carlo calculations complemented by functional information. For the ocular case, treatment position was approximately replicated, and spatial correlation was deduced from reference clips visible in both the planning radiographs and imaging CT. Here, the expected PET image was obtained from an analytical model. RESULTS: Good spatial correlation and quantitative agreement within 30% were found between the measured and expected activity. For head-and-neck patients, the beam range could be verified with an accuracy of 1-2 mm in well-coregistered bony structures. Low spine and eye sites indicated the need for better fixation and coregistration methods. An analysis of activity decay revealed as tissue-effective half-lives of 800-1,150 s. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the feasibility of postradiation PET/CT for in vivo treatment verification. It also indicates some technological and methodological improvements needed for optimal clinical application

Protons have favorable physical characteristics that yield dose distributions superior to those of photons in certain clinical situations. As of December 31, 1987, 1,678 patients had been treated. Of these, 110 had chordomas or low-grade chondrosarcomas of the base of skull. The first 68 patients have a minimum follow-up of 17 months. The median dose was 69 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE). (CGE is the dose in proton Gray multiplied by 1.1, which is the relative biological effectiveness for protons relative to 60Cobalt.) The actuarial 5-year local control rate is 82%, and the disease-free survival rate is 76%. Thirteen patients with meningiomas have been treated, following subtotal resection. The median dose was 59.4 CGE. With a median follow-up of 26 months, no patient has had tumor progression. In addition, nine patients with gliomas and 12 with craniopharyngiomas have been treated

Some patients, however, develop adverse late effects following treatment and the purpose of this study was to determine which factors give rise to a poor local outcome. METHODS: The hospital records from a first cohort of 127 patients treated by protons from 1989 to 1992 were reviewed retrospectively. The presence of rubeosis was selected as a measure of significant ocular damage. Split file analysis was performed with 73 cases forming a test group with the remaining 54 cases acting as a validation group. RESULTS: Large tumour size and the presence of retinal detachment were significant, independent risk factors for developing rubeosis for both the test and validation groups. These factors also predicted subsequent enucleation for uncontrolled ocular pain. Patients with tumours too large to plaque and with an associated retinal detachment had a 90% chance of developing rubeosis within 4 years of proton beam radiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a uveal melanoma too large for plaque therapy and an associated retinal detachment run a very high risk of developing rubeosis after proton beam radiotherapy and one third of individuals developing rubeosis required enucleation for pain even if local tumour control was satisfactory

They received total doses of 51-99.2 Gy in fractions of 2-12.5 Gy. All of the tumours responded well to the treatment. All four lesions of Bowen's disease, three of the five oral verrucous carcinomas, and the three squamous cell carcinomas completely regressed following irradiation. Two squamous cell carcinomas recurred during the follow-up period. One recurrent squamous cell carcinoma was successfully treated by a salvage surgical operation, and in the other case the patient refused further therapy. In two verrucous carcinomas there was 90% regression of tumour volume. No severe radiation-related complication occurred. As proton radiotherapy produces good local tumour control without significant morbidity to the surrounding normal tissues, it may prove to be a useful therapeutic modality for the treatment of skin carcinomas	
1	3596	The role of radiotherapy in the treatment of subtotally resected benign meningiomas	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Boston, Female, Humans, Life Tables, Male, Massachusetts, Meningeal Neoplasms/ep [Epidemiology], Meningeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Meningeal Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Meningioma/ep [Epidemiology], Meningioma/rt [Radiotherapy], Meningioma/su [Surgery], Middle Aged, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local, Photons, Prevalence, Protons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/ae [Adverse Effects], Recurrence, Remission Induction, Salvage Therapy, Survival, Time, Treatment Outcome	Thirty-six patients with benign meningioma were treated for primary or recurrent disease by subtotal resection and external beam irradiation from 1968-1986 at Massachusetts General Hospital. Comparison is made with 79 patients treated by subtotal surgery alone from 1962-1980. Progression-free survival for 17 patients irradiated after initial incomplete surgery was 88% at 8 years compared with 48% for similar patients treated by surgery alone (p = 0.057). 16 patients incompletely resected at time of first recurrence were irradiated and 78% were progression-free at 8 years while 11% of a similar group treated by surgery alone were progression free (p = 0.001). Long term overall survival was high and similar in both control and study groups. Two patients were irradiated at second recurrence and 1 patient at third recurrence. Twenty-five patients were treated with photons alone and have a median follow-up of 57 months, 6 patients have recurred at doses 45-60 Gy. Eleven patients were treated with combined 10 MV photons and 160 MV protons utilizing 3-D treatment planning. These patients have been followed for a median of 53 months and none have failed to date. Eight of 11 received 54-60.4 Gy and 3/11 greater than 64.48 Gy. Sex, age, pathology grade and score, surgery and timing of radiation therapy were not associated with significant differences in failure patterns within the irradiated study group (p less than 0.1). Complications have been seen in 6 irradiated patients

1	163	Survival implications of enucleation after definitive radiotherapy for choroidal melanoma: an example of regression on time-dependent covariates	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Choroid Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Choroid Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Choroid Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Cobalt Radioisotopes, Cobalt Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Cohort Studies, Dose Fractionation, Eye Enucleation, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Melanoma/mo [Mortality], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Melanoma/su [Surgery], Middle Aged, Proportional Hazards Models, Prospective Studies, Protons, Radiotherapy, Regression Analysis, Survival Rate, Time Factors, Treatment Failure	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether the removal of the eye after radiotherapy alters the rates of metastatic death in patients with melanoma of the choroid. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using an extension of the Cox model, we based our analysis on a cohort of 1541 consecutive patients with unilateral choroidal or ciliary body melanoma treated with protons (70 cobalt-gray equivalent in 5 to 7 fractions) at the Harvard University (Boston, Mass) cyclotron between July 1, 1975, through December 31, 1993, and who were observed prospectively up to September 30, 1995. Patient survival and the status of the treated eye were updated annually. RESULTS: By September 1995 (median follow-up among survivors, 8 years), 137 patients underwent enucleation after radiotherapy for complications (n=103) or tumor regrowth (n=34). The overall 10-year rate of eye retention was 89% (95% confidence interval, 87%-91%). Of the 1541 patients, 300 died of tumor metastasis, 38 following enucleation of the affected eye (mean interval from enucleation to death, 25 months). The multivariate rate ratio for metastatic death associated with enucleation (modeled as a time-dependent covariate) was 0.9 (95% confidence interval, 0.6-1.4) for enucleation due to complications and 3.8 (95% confidence interval, 2.3-6.3) for enucleation associated with tumor regrowth. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of tumor viability, enucleation after primary irradiation for choroidal melanoma has no deleterious effect on patients' survival. Enucleation concurrent with tumor regrowth is associated with high death rates; growth of the tumor in the eye may presage systemic recurrence and death from metastasis

Improved survival has led to increased interest in late effects of treatment. The objective of this study was to review the results of treating orbital RMS with multidisciplinary treatment at Women's and Children's Hospital and Royal Adelaide Hospital with emphasis on late effects of treatment. A retrospective review was carried out of all patients with orbital RMS treated with multidisciplinary treatment including radiation therapy and chemotherapy in the two institutions between 1982 and 2002. A total of five patients (age range 5.5-12 years) satisfied the eligibility requirements. Late effects were significant and included facial bone hypoplasia, cataract formation and growth hormone deficiency. Overall survival was 80% (4/5) with mean follow up of 8 years (range 3-13 years). Given the high cure rates achieved, future treatments must aim to maintain the good results but to reduce the high incidence of late effects of treatment. Standardised rating of late toxicity, long-term follow-up clinics, and implementation of modern radiation techniques (3-D conformal radiotherapy, intensity modulated radiotherapy, proton therapy) for patients with orbital RMS are important to improving outcome

Fourteen patients were treated with surgery alone: eight patients with primary tumors in the sacrococcygeal region were treated with radical surgery and four are alive with no evidence of disease (NED) with follow-up of 8 to 20 years. Recurrent tumors in six patients were treated with surgery alone resulting in long palliation (3-25 years). The actuarial survival rate at 5 years for all patients treated with surgery was 76%. Radiation therapy was used in patients after either a biopsy (15), partial excision (17), or before radical excision in 2 patients. To achieve a worthwhile level of palliation, doses greater than 4000 cGy were required. High-dose levels (greater than 6500 cGy) were achieved in nine cases by a combination of photon and 160 MeV proton beams. The results to date of this approach for lesions of the base of skull and cervical vertebral body are encouraging: high local control and low morbidity. The 5-year actuarial survival rate of all patients treated with radiation was 50%

The tumor was entirely within the treatment region in all patients. The fraction of the predicted high-dose and low-dose regions corresponding with an absolute scotoma was fitted by a linear regression model (r2 = .721) with three independent variables: dose region, initial condition, and time since therapy. The defect in the maximum-dose region increased at an average rate of 0.270/year. This differed (P = .002) from the rate in the penumbra region: (0.104/year). The rate in the penumbra differed (P = .01) from that in the predicted low-dose region, where scotoma did not increase with time. The pattern and time course of visual field loss in the different radiation dose regions tended to support the conclusion that isodose calculations are accurate. The data were consistent with the hypothesis that visual loss secondary to irradiation results primarily from radiation vasculopathy and not from direct damage to photoreceptors or ganglion cells. Development of an absolute scotoma may require a dose in excess of 5,000 rads

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixteen patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma initially treated with 50.0-88.2 Gy photons were re-treated with protons to additional doses of 59.4-70.2 CGE. Local-regional control and survival were correlated with extent of relapse, recurrence versus persistence, and prescribed dose and were subjected to dose-volume histogram analysis. Mean follow-up was 23.7 months (range, 4-47 months). RESULTS: Twenty-four-month actuarial overall and local-regional progression-free survival rates were both 50%. The 24-month actuarial overall survival rates for patients with "optimal" dose-volume histogram coverage versus "suboptimal" coverage were 83% and 17%, respectively (P = .006). Doses to critical structures were low (0-22.0 Gy); no central nervous system side effects supervened. CONCLUSION: Adequate tumor coverage, as evaluated by using dose-volume histogram analysis, was found to be the most important variable influencing local-regional control and survival. No central nervous system complications were observed; increases in the dose to adjacent critical structures are being evaluated	
0	157	What is the role of radiation in the treatment of subfoveal membranes: review of radiobiologic, pathologic, and other considerations to initiate a multimodality discussion. [Review] [104 refs]	Aged, Animals, Cerebrovascular Circulation/re [Radiation Effects], Choroid/bs [Blood Supply], Humans, Macular Degeneration/rt [Radiotherapy], Microcirculation/de [Drug Effects], Neovascularization,Pathologic/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Radiobiology, Radiotherapy Dosage, Rats, Research, Retina/re [Radiation Effects], Retinal Neovascularization/rt [Radiotherapy], Visual Acuity	BACKGROUND: Single-dose-fraction conformal proton beam and multiple-fraction X ray dose schedules have been used to treat subfoveal neovascular membranes. All schedules successfully controlled membrane progression, stabilized vision in most patients, and increased visual acuity in some. Conformal protons also decreased the radiation dose to healthy tissues outside the designated volume (16 mm in diameter). It appears that radiation therapy could be useful and cost-effective, but neither the optimal time-dose schedule single or multiple dose fractions nor the type of radiation proton conformal beam or x-ray therapy are defined. METHODS: By means of an extensive literature survey, we reviewed the rationale for using radiation to treat subfoveal neovascularization, examined a paradigm of radiation interaction with tissue, reviewed the histopathology of neovascular membranes, and documented the role of growth factors in the pathophysiology of the disease. Accepting that the eye is an extracranial brain extension, and that its microvasculature has properties similar to brain microvessels, we reviewed the radiobiologic response of brain microvessels. We also revisited the controversy concerning the efficacy of single-dose-fraction vs. multifraction schedules. RESULTS: This paper outlines parameters within which radiation therapy's role might be defined, and proposes a clinical radiation-biology scoring program to evaluate radiation effects, based on the SOMA concept. CONCLUSION: A prospective, controlled clinical trial is feasible and is indicated to determine radiation therapy's role in managing the proliferative component of age-related macular degeneration.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Bile duct carcinomas are notoriously difficult to cure, with locoregional recurrence the rule, even after radical resection. Adjuvant efforts have included various radiation modalities, with limited success. Recently, charged-particle radiotherapy has also been used in these patients. METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective chart analysis of 129 patients with bile duct adenocarcinomas treated between 1977 and 1987 through the University of California at San Francisco, including 22 patients treated at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory with the charged particles helium and neon. The minimum follow-up was 5 years. Survival, outcome, and complication results were analyzed. RESULTS: Sixty-two patients were treated with surgery alone (S), 45 patients received conventional adjuvant x-ray radiotherapy (S + X), and 22 were treated with charged particles (S + CP). The median survival times were 6.5, 11, and 14 months, respectively, for the entire group, and 16, 16, and 23 months in patients treated with curative intent. There was a survival difference in patients undergoing total resection compared with debulking (p = 0.05) and minor resections (p = 0.0001). Patients with microscopic residual disease had increased median survival times when they were treated with adjuvant irradiation, most markedly after CP (p = 0.0005) but also with conventional X (p = 0.0109). Patients with gross residual disease had a less marked but still statistically significant extended survival (p = 0.05 for S + X and p = 0.0423 for S + CP) after irradiatio CONCLUSIONS: The mainstay of bile duct carcinoma management was maximal surgical resection in these patients. Postoperative radiotherapy gave patients with positive microscopic margins a significant survival advantage and may be of value in selected patients with gross disease

Thirty-two patients were studied, 12 of whom underwent brachytherapy with 106Ru plaques and 20 of whom were treated with accelerated protons. After a follow-up period of 12 months, the following was observed: reduction of the thickness of the tumor (significantly greater in the tumors which underwent brachytherapy) and morphological and structural changes which consisted in a thinning of the tumor and an increased reflectivity

Patient outcome following standard dose radiotherapy or following a 12.5% increase in total dose to 75.6 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE) using a conformal perineal proton boost was compared for local tumor control, disease-free survival, and overall survival. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Stage T3-T4, Nx, N0-2, M0 patients received 50.4 Gy by four-field photons and were randomized to receive either an additional 25.2 CGE by conformal protons (arm 1--the high dose arm, 103 patients, total dose 75.6 CGE) or an additional 16.8 Gy by photons (arm 2--the conventional dose arm, 99 patients, total dose 67.2 Gy). Actuarial overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), total recurrence-free survival (TRFS), (clinically free, prostate specific antigen (PSA) less than 4ng/ml and a negative prostate rebiopsy, done in 38 patients without evidence of disease) and local control (digital rectal exam and rebiopsy negative) were evaluated. RESULTS: The protocol completion rate was 90% for arm 1 and 97% for arm 2. With a median follow-up of 61 months (range 3 to 139 months) 135 patients are alive and 67 have died, 20 from causes other than prostate cancer. We found no significant differences in OS, DSS, TRFS or local control between the two arms. Among those completing randomized treatment (93 in arm 1 and 96 in arm 2), the local control at 5 and 8 years for arm 1 is 92% and 77%, respectively and is 80% and 60%, respectively for arm 2 (p = .089) and there are no significant differences in OS, DSS, and TRFS. The local control for the 57 patients with poorly differentiated (Gleason 4 or 5 of 5) tumors at 5 and 8 years for arm 1 is 94% and 84% and is 64% and 19% on arm 2 (p = 0.0014). In patients whose digital rectal exam had normalized following treatment and underwent prostate rebiopsy there was a lower positive rebiopsy rate for arm 1 versus arm 2 patients (28 vs. 45%) and also for those with well and moderately differentiated tumors versus poorly differentiated tumors (32 and 50%). These differences were not statistically significant. Grade 1 and 2 rectal bleeding is higher (32 vs. 12%, p = 0.002) as may be urethral stricture (19 vs. 8%, p = 0.07) in the arm 1 versus arm 2. CONCLUSIONS: An increase in prostate tumor dose by external beam of 12.5% to 75.6 CGE by a conformal proton boost compared to a conventional dose of 67.2 Gy by a photon boost significantly improved local control only in patients with poorly differentiated tumors. It has increased late radiation sequelae, and as yet, has not increased overall survival, disease-specific survival, or total recurrence-free survival in any subgroup. These results have led us to test by a subsequent Phase III trial the potential beneficial effect on local control and disease-specific survival of a 12.5% increase in total dose relative to conventional dose in patients with T1, T2a, and T2b tumors

METHODS AND MATERIALS: We followed 11 patients receiving an exclusive external radiation therapy for brain tumor for 8 months. They underwent proton MRS scans before any radiation exposure and 1, 4, and 8 months after they began the radiation therapy. The patients received 60 Gy in tumoral area fractionated over 6 weeks. The contralateral normal brain hemisphere received a radiation dose from 20 to 50 Gy. The main metabolite concentrations (N-acetylaspartate (NAA), choline compounds (Cho), creatine (Cr), and lactate (Lac) were evaluated by the areas of the peaks after peak fitting. Normalized values (NV) were obtained by processing the ratio of the peak area of a given metabolite to the sum of all the spectrum peak areas; ratios (NAA/Cho, NAA/Cr, and Cho/Cr) were processed. One patient, who received panencephalic radiotherapy (30 Gy) after metastasectomy from a primary kidney adenocarcinoma, has been monitored with 1H-MRS eight times for 6 months to observe the onset of the metabolic changes. RESULTS: Changes were observed in irradiated normal brain tissue 4 months after radiation therapy began: the NAA/Cho and NAA/Cr ratios and the NAA (NV) decreased while the Choline (NV) increased. Four months later, normal values were recovered. CONCLUSION: 1H-MRS has the potentiality to detect and to evaluate in vivo early adverse metabolic effects of radiation therapy in the normal human brain. These changes are significant 4 months after the radiation therapy began and appear to resolve over time

Proton beam therapy has been advocated by Zografos and associates as optimal for treating these tumours in this critical region as charged particles have a highly localised and uniform dose distribution. PATIENTS: We present 3 cases of CCH treated with proton beam therapy. Two patients developed radiation optic neuropathy and maculopathy, and one had a persistent exudative macular detachment following treatment. CONCLUSION: Our experience with proton therapy of these tumours has been disappointing in preventing radiation optic neuropathy and maculopathy and offers little advantage over external irradiation. The majority of our patients with this condition are now treated with low-dose lens-sparing external beam radiotherapy or brachytherapy, which has encouraging visual results and is a far more cost-effective option

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between October 1998 and October 2003, 29 patients (median age, 39 years) with chordomas (n = 18) and CS (n = 11) were treated at the Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI) with protons using the main 510-MeV cyclotron. Tumor conformal application of proton beams was realized by spot scanning technology. The median chordoma and CS dose was 74 and 68 cobalt Gy equivalent, respectively (cobalt Gy equivalent = proton Gy x 1.1). Median gross tumor volumes (GTV) were 16.4 mL (range, 1.8-48.1 mL) and 15.2 mL (range, 2.3-57.3 mL) for chordoma and CS, respectively. Late toxicity was assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, v3.0) grading system. The median follow-up time was 29 months (range, 6-68 months). RESULTS: Actuarial 3-year local control rates were 87.5% and 100% for chordoma and CS, respectively. We observed one surgical pathway and one marginal failure in patients with chordomas. No regional failure or distant metastasis was observed. At 3 years, actuarial PFS and OS for the entire cohort was 90% and 93.8%, respectively. Actuarial 3-year complication-free survival was 82.2%. Radiation-induced pituitary dysfunction was observed in 4 (14%) patients (CTCAE Grade 2). No patient presented with post-PT brainstem or optic pathways necrosis or dysfunction. In univariate analysis, age < or =40 years at the time of PT affected favorably on PFS (p = 0.09). CONCLUSION: Spot-scanning PT offers high tumor control rates of skull base chordoma and CS. These results compare favorably to other combined proton-photon or carbon ion irradiation series. Observed toxicity was acceptable. Younger age (< or =40 years) was a favorable prognostic factor of PFS. These preliminary results are encouraging but should be confirmed during a longer follow-up

The ability to achieve high degrees of radiation dose conformity by using protons has resulted in higher radiation doses than can be delivered with conventional radiotherapy in the base of skull. High target volume doses have led to improved tumor control and patient survival. Side effects such as severe toxicity are acceptable considering the alternatives of uncontrolled tumor growth. The authors of various analyses have identified prognostic factors that can be used to predict a patient's chance of treatment success. On the horizon are important technical developments that will further increase dose conformity and increase target doses. In this paper the author reviews long-term outcome data and prognostic predictors for survival of patients with skull base chordomas based on the largest worldwide patient series. [References: 20]

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between December 1995 and January 2000, 67 patients with a median age of 52.3 years (14-85), were treated using 201 MeV proton beam of the centre de protontherapie d'Orsay (CPO), 49 for a chordoma and 18 for a chondrosarcoma. Irradiation combined high-energy photons and protons. Photons represented 2/3 of the total dose and protons 1/3. The median total dose delivered within gross tumour volume was 67 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE) (60-70). RESULTS: With a mean follow-up of 32 months (4-71), the 3-year local control rates were for chordomas and chondrosarcomas of 70.8% and 85.2%, respectively and 4-year overall survival rates of 87.7% and 75%, respectively. Fourteen tumours (21.5%) failed locally (eight within the gross tumor volume, four into the CTV and 2 in an unknown site). Seven patients died of tumour and one of intercurrent disease. In univariate analysis, age inferieur ou egal a 52.3 years (p = 0.002), maximum tumoral diameter < 44.7 mm (p = 0.02) and GTV < 28.4 mL (0.02), at time of radiotherapy, influenced positively the local control. According to multivariate analysis, only age was an independent prognostic factor of local control. Only five (7.7%) patients presented grade 3 or 4 complications. CONCLUSION: In base of skull chordomas and chondrosarcomas, the combined photon and proton therapy offers excellent chances of cure at the price of an acceptable toxicity. These results should be confirmed with a longer follow-up

After treatment by heavy ion beam therapy, pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy was performed. The tumor was pT3, pN0, pM0, stage IIA. Sixteen months after the surgery, the patient was admitted to the hospital because he was vomiting blood. Hemorrhaging caused by failure of the cut end of the gastroduodenal artery into the elevated jejunum was confirmed by angiogram, and the hemorrhaging could be stopped by a transcatheter arterial embolization operation. Twenty-four months after surgery, the patient was readmitted because he was once again vomiting blood. Hemorrhaging from the elevated jejunum was suspected by hemorrhagic scintigram, but the source could not be identified on further examination, and the choice of treatment was difficult. The patient died on the 9th day after admittance to the hospital. Even on examination at autopsy, the source of the hemorrhaging could not be identified. No recurrence of cancer could be found. This has proven to be a perplexing case, in that hemorrhaging from the end of the routinely cut gastroduodenal artery occurred 16 and 24 months after heavy ion beam therapy and pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy for pancreatic cancer

METHODS: Over a 20-year period, 47 patients underwent 72 operative procedures for resection of cranial base chondrosarcomas. Thirty-three patients were previously untreated, whereas 14 patients previously had undergone surgery or radiation. Twenty-three patients had a single operation and 24 underwent staged (more than one) operations because of extensive disease. Patients who underwent subtotal resection also underwent radiotherapy or radiosurgery. Patients were evaluated at follow-up clinically and by imaging studies. RESULTS: Gross total resection was accomplished in 29 (61.7%) patients, and subtotal resection was accomplished in 18 patients (38.3%). The resection was better in patients who underwent a primary operation (gross total resection, 68.8 versus 46.7%) rather than a reoperation. Patients who underwent incomplete resection underwent postoperative radiotherapy, which included proton beam radiotherapy (15.6%), radiosurgery (68%), and fractionated radiation (15.6%). There were no operative deaths. Postoperative complications (cerebrospinal fluid leakage, quadriparesis, infections, cranial nerve palsies, etc.) were observed in 10 patients (18%). The follow-up ranged from 2 to 255 months, with an average of 86 months. At the conclusion of study, 36 (76.6%) patients were alive, and 21 (44.7%) patients were alive without disease. Recurrence-free survival was 32% at 10 years in all patients, 42.3% in primary patients and 13.8% in those who underwent reoperation. The Karnofsky performance score was 82.4 +/- 9.8 before surgery, 85 +/- 12.5 at 1 year after surgery, and 85.3 +/- 5.8 at the latest follow-up. Two patients died as a result of radiotherapy complications (malignancy, radiation necrosis). CONCLUSION: Cranial base chondrosarcomas can be managed well by complete surgical resection or by a combination of surgery and radiotherapy. The study cannot comment about the efficacy of radiotherapy. Approximately half of the patients survived without recurrence at long-term follow-up (>132 mo). The functional status of the surviving patients was excellent at follow-up

Surgical management is the primary therapeutic modality. With the use of modern surgical techniques, recurrence is infrequent, and facial nerve sparing is the norm. However, for patients with recurrent disease, the risk of further relapses is increased with surgical resection alone, particularly for those patients in whom multiple recurrences have already occurred. The role of adjuvant radiotherapy in this setting remains uncertain. Although neutron radiotherapy is superior to conventional radiotherapy for malignant salivary gland tumors, its role in the treatment of pleomorphic adenomas is less well defined. We report our experience using this modality for high-risk, recurrent pleomorphic adenomas. METHODS: Sixteen patients were treated with neutron radiotherapy for recurrent pleomorphic adenomas of major salivary glands from 1986 through 1993. The median age at diagnosis was 33 years (range, 11-77 years); median age at the time of neutron radiotherapy was 52 years (range, 22-77 years); median number of prior surgical procedures was 3 (range, 1-6); median duration from initial diagnosis to radiotherapy was 14.5 years (range, 3 months-30 years); median follow-up was 83 months (range, 9-144 months). The median period at risk for survivors was 96 months (defined as the interval from completion of neutron radiotherapy to last follow-up). Ten patients had evidence of gross residual disease at the time of treatment as determined by imaging studies, with nine patients having multinodular disease. RESULTS: The 10-year actuarial survival was 79%. One patient died from lung metastases 9 months after treatment; one patient died from a liver tumor of uncertain origin, but the histology could not rule out a metastasis from the previous pleomorphic adenoma; and one patient died from recurrent disease at the base of skull. The 15-year actuarial locoregional control rate was 85%. One of the two patients with locoregional recurrence had a malignant transformation into an adenocarcinoma. No statistical difference in 15-year actuarial survival (75% vs 83%, p =.82) was found comparing patients with gross residual disease vs microscopic residual disease. The actuarial 15-year locoregional control was 76% for patients with gross residual disease vs 100% for those with microscopic disease. The 15-year actuarial risk of RTOG/ESTRO nonaudiologic grade III/IV complications was 21%. No facial nerve injuries were observed as a direct consequence of neutron radiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Neutron radiotherapy offers both excellent local control rates and survival rates in patients with multiply recurrent pleomorphic adenomas that are not candidates for surgical resection, even in the presence of gross residual disease. The treatment-related morbidity is acceptable. Malignant transformations and metastases, although uncommon, may be observed in this tumor. Copyright 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc

METHODS: Four patients with unresectable solitary hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma underwent 55-82 Gy proton-beam irradiation for a period of 15-47 days. Follow-up CT including plain, enhanced and dynamic imaging was performed for a period of 9-36 months. RESULTS: Good preservation of arterial blood supply while gradual decrease in tumour size was clearly depicted by dynamic CT. CONCLUSION: We believe that preservation of hypervascularity as judged by enhancement at CT and magnetic resonance imaging, does not necessarily mean that radiotherapy in hypervascular malignant tumours has been unsuccessful

There is no established treatment plan for the disease, which may be attributed to its rarity and aggressiveness. Surgery is the choice of treatment in early cases. Radiotherapy follows surgery, and chemotherapy has an insignificant role in its treatment. Radiation with heavy ion beams is showing promising results in cancer therapy. Compared to conventional radiation, it permits selective irradiation with minimal injury to the surrounding normal tissue, and treatment with a low dose within a short interval of time is possible. We herein report a case of PMME treated with heavy ion radiation, the first case to be reported so far, and review the relevant literature

Olfactory neuroblastoma is a rare disease, and a standard treatment strategy has not been established. Radiation therapy for ONB is challenging because of the proximity of ONBs to critical organs. Proton-beam therapy can provide better dose distribution compared with X-ray irradiation because of its physical characteristics, and is deemed to be a feasible treatment modality. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A retrospective review was performed on 14 patients who underwent PBT for ONB as definitive treatment at the National Cancer Center Hospital East (Kashiwa, Chiba, Japan) from November 1999 to February 2005. A total dose of PBT was 65 cobalt Gray equivalents (Gy(E)), with 2.5-Gy(E) once-daily fractionations. RESULTS: The median follow-up period for surviving patients was 40 months. One patient died from disseminated disease. There were two persistent diseases, one of which was successfully salvaged with surgery. The 5-year overall survival rate was 93%, the 5-year local progression-free survival rate was 84%, and the 5-year relapse-free survival rate was 71%. Liquorrhea was observed in one patient with Kadish's stage C disease (widely destroying the skull base). Most patients experienced Grade 1 to 2 dermatitis in the acute phase. No other adverse events of Grade 3 or greater were observed according to the RTOG/EORTC acute and late morbidity scoring system. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results of PBT for ONB achieved excellent local control and survival outcomes without serious adverse effects. Proton-beam therapy is considered a safe and effective modality that warrants further study

The median time between irradiation and enucleation in the 64 enucleated eyes was 13 months. The probability of retaining the eye was 95 and 90%, 2 and 5 years postirradiation, respectively. Three percent of eyes were enucleated during posttreatment year 1, and the yearly rate was 1% by the fourth year. No patient had enucleation later than 5 1/2 years posttreatment. The complication most likely to result in enucleation was neovascular glaucoma although this was frequently managed without enucleation. Other common reasons for enucleation were documented or suspected tumor growth and complete retinal detachment with associated loss of vision. The leading risk factors for enucleation were anterior tumor margin involving the ciliary body, tumor height greater than 8 mm, and proximity of the tumor to the fovea. Based on the presence or absence of these factors, 5-year eye retention rates were 99, 92, and 76% for low-, moderate-, and high-risk groups, respectively. Thus, the probability of eye retention after proton beam irradiation is high even among those at greatest risk of enucleation	
0	200	Multiple fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy of residual pituitary macroadenomas: initial experience	Adenoma/pa [Pathology], Adenoma/su [Surgery], Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Middle Aged, Pituitary Gland,Anterior/pa [Pathology], Pituitary Gland,Anterior/su [Surgery], Pituitary Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Pituitary Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Treatment Outcome	OBJECTIVE: We describe our initial experience with fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) for the treatment of 19 patients with secretory and nonsecretory pituitary macroadenomas. The primary endpoints of local control and the documentation of any MRI T2-weighted changes in contiguous brain tissues are discussed. METHODS: Between 1/95 and 1/97, 19 patients were planned with the X-Knife 3-D planning system (Radionics, Burlington, Mass., USA) and received a median dose of 46 Gy in daily 2.0-Gy fractions. Treatments were delivered stereotactically with a dedicated 600SR linear accelerator (Varian Corporation, Palo Alto, Calif., USA). Immobilization was achieved with the Gill-Thomas-Cosman relocatable frame. The mean tumor size was 2.24 cm. The mean prescription isodose was 87%. The mean age was 53 years (10 male, 9 female). The mean follow-up time was 10 months (range 1-24 months). The mean optic chiasm and brain stem doses were calculated at 38 and 13 Gy, respectively. All patients were evaluated with pre- and postgadolinum-enhanced MRI scans and Humphrey visual field tests. RESULTS: In the posttreatment period, local control (absence of tumor progression) has been achieved in all of the patients. The treatment was well tolerated in all patients. No acute complications, no visual changes and no T2-weighted MRI or proton density changes were documented in any of the 19 patients. CONCLUSION: These preliminary results suggest that SRT compares favorably with conventional radiotherapy in achieving local control. The doses to the brainstem and the temporal lobes are significantly decreased and at early follow-up no white matter changes are seen on MRI after SRT. The true frequency of grade 1-4 changes are likely underestimated as similar changes often occur in association with tumor edema or after surgery. Given the uncertain neurocognitive significance of the white matter changes associated with treating these benign tumors by conventional radiotherapy, we are currently treating all pituitary adenomas with fractionated SRT to reduce the potential sequelae	
0	4077	Definitive proton beam radiation therapy for inoperable gastric cancer: a report of two cases	Adenocarcinoma, Adenocarcinoma/pa [Pathology], Adenocarcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Aged, Aged,80 and over, Biopsy, Humans, Japan, Male, Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Skin, Stomach Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Stomach Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Stomach Ulcer/di [Diagnosis], Stomach Ulcer/pa [Pathology], Stomach/pa [Pathology], Universities	Proton beam radiation therapy using 250 MeV protons was carried out on two patients with early gastric cancer (T1, N0, M0). One patient was an 85-year-old man with early gastric cancer of type IIa + IIc. The other one was a 70 year old man with early gastric cancer of type IIc. In both cases histological examination of biopsy specimens showed differentiated adenocarcinoma; distant metastasis was not found by other examinations. Both patients were considered inoperable due to their poor cardiac and/or respiratory functions. Therefore, it was decided to treat them by definitive proton irradiation, delivering total doses of 86 Gy and 83 Gy, respectively. In both patients, skin erythema that did not require any special treatment was found in the irradiation field. Hematobiological examinations did not show any abnormality. Although endoscopic examination at two years after irradiation in the former case and at seven months in the latter case showed persistent gastric ulcer at the site of the cancerous lesions, cancer cells were not found histologically. Therefore, we concluded that proton irradiation therapy was useful for inoperable early gastric cancers

Shielding of previously treated and uninvolved areas was achieved by encapsulating cerrobend within a thermoplastic shell in one patient. In the other patient, GE Saturnes unique asymmetric electron field definition facility was used. Satisfactory dose uniformity was demonstrated by the computation of dose distributions on the full summed electron pencil beam model on the Target Series 2 treatment planning system. Verification of the calculated dose homogeneity was confirmed with lithium fluoride (TLD-100) thermoluminescent dosimetry. The relatively simple treatment set-up was accomplished easily on a routine basis and was well tolerated by the patients, both of whom have been in complete remission since their treatment

We have made it a rule to do field localization by X-ray pictures before each treatment. For this purpose we have developed a localize-verify system consisting of a fluoroscopic unit and a real time digital image processing device. By using this system as well as X-ray films, field placement errors or corrected distance at field localization were measured in 11 patients with esophageal cancers. Measurements of corrected distances on a total of 177 localization attempts disclosed that correction by > 5 mm was necessary in 30.6% and by > 10 mm in 10.2% of all localization attempts. Corrected distances appeared to increase with age, possibly because the skin becomes looser and ambulatory status tends to be more limited in older patients. Field placement corrections of more than 5 mm were required in 66.7% of 60 localizations in patients > 80 years old. Two patients in whom the anatomical positions of the esophagus were easily movable are presented. The following common characteristics of these patients were considered high risk factors: they were more than 80 years old; lesions were located in the lower esophagus; and they had T1 tumors. These findings suggested that frequent positioning and verification of treatment fields are necessary in the accurate treatment of esophageal cancers, especially those in high-risk patients

There are several methods of managing them. Validity of these methods, however, is not sufficiently studied. We therefore investigated, whether moist skin care with 3% urea lotion will reduce acute radiation skin toxicity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 88 patients with carcinomas of the head and neck undergoing radiotherapy with curative intent (mean total dose 60 Gy, range: 50-74 Gy) were evaluated weekly for acute skin reactions according to the RTOG-CTC score. In 63 patients, moist skin care with 3% urea lotion was performed. The control group consisted of 25 patients receiving conventional dry skin care. The incidence of grade I, II, and III reactions and the radiation dose at occurrence of a particular reaction were determined and statistically analyzed using the log-rank test. The dose-time relations of individual skin reactions are described. RESULTS: At some point of time during radiotherapy, all patients suffered from acute skin reactions grade I, > 90% from grade II reactions. 50% of patients receiving moist skin care experienced grade I reactions at 26 Gy as compared to 22 Gy in control patients (p = 0.03). Grade II reactions occurred at 51 Gy versus 34 Gy (p = 0.006). Further, 22% of the patients treated with moist skin care suffered from acute skin toxicity grade III as compared to 56% of the controls (p = 0.0007). CONCLUSION: Moist skin care with 3% urea lotion delays the occurrence and reduces the grade of acute skin reactions in percutaneously irradiated patients with head and neck tumors

DESIGN: Prospective phase I/II study. SETTING: University medical center. PATIENTS AND INTERVENTIONS: Ten patients with stage I-II non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and FEV(1) < or = 1.0 L were irradiated with protons to areas of gross disease only, using 51 cobalt gray equivalents (CGE) in 10 fractions (protocol 1). Fifteen patients with stage I-IIIA NSCLC and FEV(1) > 1.0 L received 45-Gy photon irradiation to the primary lung tumor and the mediastinum, plus a 28.8-CGE proton boost to the gross tumor volume (protocol 2). MEASUREMENTS: Pulmonary function was evaluated prior to treatment and 1 month, 3 months, and 6 to 12 months following irradiation. RESULTS: In patients receiving protocol 1, no significant changes in pulmonary function occurred. In patients receiving protocol 2, at 6 to 12 months, the diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide had declined from 61% of predicted to 45% of predicted (p < 0.05), total lung capacity had declined from 114% of predicted to 95% of predicted (p < 0.05), and residual volume had declined from 160% of predicted to 132% of predicted (p < 0.05). Airway resistance increased from 3.8 to 5.2 cm H(2)O/L/s (p < 0.05). No statistically significant changes occurred in vital capacity, FEV(1), or PaO(2). CONCLUSIONS: Our observations indicate that it is feasible to apply higher-than-conventional doses of radiation at a higher-than-conventional dose per fraction without excess pulmonary toxicity when conformal radiation techniques with protons are used

The CBCT projection data of a phantom were acquired during rotational megavoltage (MV) dose delivery up to 6 Gy to evaluate image quality under MV beam irradiation. A lung tumor patient was treated with a total dose of 48 Gy in four fractions, each fraction including seven coplanar and noncoplanar beams, as well as a full-angle rotational beam. Tumor registration was performed between a planning CT image and a CBCT image immediately after patient setup. The patient couch was adjusted according to the registration results, and then the registration was repeated three times: immediately before treatment, during treatment, and immediately after treatment. The phantom image quality of the kV CBCT was not visually degraded up to the rotational MV dose of 6 Gy. Tumor position during rotational dose delivery was verified for the first time using kV CBCT

METHODS: A retrospective chart and film review was performed for all patients treated for medulloblastoma at the Insitute for Neurology and Neurosurgery/Beth Israel Medical Center between August 1996 and the present. The clinical and radiographic histories of pediatric patients (ages 3-21 years at diagnosis) with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of medulloblastoma who received craniospinal radiation therapy were reviewed. Fifty-nine patients were identified, with a mean age at radiation treatment of 7.7 years and a mean follow-up time of 7.2 years. The dose to the craniospinal axis was 24 Gy (31 patients) or 36 Gy (28 patients). The radiation energy in the craniospinal axis was provided by photons in 55 patients and protons in four. All patients received a posterior fossa boost of 54 Gy (46 patients) or 72 Gy (13 patients). Twenty-six lesions developed in 18 patients (31%) during the observation period. The cumulative incidence of lesion development was 5.6, 14, and 43%, at 3, 5, and 10 years, respectively. The sites of occurrence were cerebral (20 cases) and cerebellar (six cases). There was no significant correlation between age at diagnosis, sex, craniospinal radiation dose or energy source, and lesion development. Only one patient required surgical intervention for a symptomatic hemorrhagic lesion in the frontal lobe. Histological analysis in this case was consistent with cavernoma. CONCLUSIONS: Cavernomas are common after cranial irradiation in children, and their incidence increases over time. Most of these lesions follow a benign course and do not require intervention

Three fractions of 1.80 Gy, 4 h apart, were given on three treatment days per week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday), and the tumour dose was taken to 59.40 Gy in 33 fractions in 24-25 days. Acute mucosal reactions were generally quite severe, but a split was avoided by providing the patient with intensive support, often as an in-patient, until the reactions settled. Late radiation effects have been comparable to those obtained with conventional fractionation. The probability of local-regional control was 47% at 3 years for 69 previously untreated patients, whereas it was only 12% at one year for 20 patients treated for recurrence after radical surgery. Fifty-eight previously untreated patients with tumours arising in the upper aero-digestive tract were analysed in greater detail. The probability of local-regional control at 3 years was 78% for 17 Stage III patients and 15% for 31 Stage IV patients. This schedule of continuous AFRT is feasible and merits further investigation

OBJECTIVE: To examine whether childbearing may be a favorable prognostic factor in melanoma of the uveal tract. DESIGN: Prospective follow-up study. SETTING: Hospital. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Death from metastatic choroidal melanoma. METHODS: We evaluated a consecutive series of 1818 patients with choroidal melanoma, 748 parous and 165 nulliparous women and 905 men, after treatment with proton irradiation. Three hundred fifty-two deaths from metastasis were documented in follow-up. RESULTS: Overall multivariate-adjusted death rates from metastasis were approximately 25% higher in nulliparous women (relative risk [RR], 1.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.83-1.82) and men (RR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.00-1.56) than in women who had given birth. The protective influence of parity was strongest in the early period following diagnosis and treatment (RR, 1.58; 95% CI, 0.88-2.86, and RR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.04-2.19, in nulliparous women and men, respectively, during the first 36 months of follow-up). The level of protection increased with the number of live births (P for trend, .04). CONCLUSION: These data provide support for the hypothesis that a history of childbearing confers protection from death in choroidal melanoma

Patient outcome following standard dose radiotherapy or following a 12.5% increase in total dose to 75.6 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE) using a conformal perineal proton boost was compared for local tumor control, disease-free survival, and overall survival. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Stage T3-T4, Nx, N0-2, M0 patients received 50.4 Gy by four-field photons and were randomized to receive either an additional 25.2 CGE by conformal protons (arm 1--the high dose arm, 103 patients, total dose 75.6 CGE) or an additional 16.8 Gy by photons (arm 2--the conventional dose arm, 99 patients, total dose 67.2 Gy). Actuarial overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), total recurrence-free survival (TRFS), (clinically free, prostate specific antigen (PSA) less than 4ng/ml and a negative prostate rebiopsy, done in 38 patients without evidence of disease) and local control (digital rectal exam and rebiopsy negative) were evaluated. RESULTS: The protocol completion rate was 90% for arm 1 and 97% for arm 2. With a median follow-up of 61 months (range 3 to 139 months) 135 patients are alive and 67 have died, 20 from causes other than prostate cancer. We found no significant differences in OS, DSS, TRFS or local control between the two arms. Among those completing randomized treatment (93 in arm 1 and 96 in arm 2), the local control at 5 and 8 years for arm 1 is 92% and 77%, respectively and is 80% and 60%, respectively for arm 2 (p = .089) and there are no significant differences in OS, DSS, and TRFS. The local control for the 57 patients with poorly differentiated (Gleason 4 or 5 of 5) tumors at 5 and 8 years for arm 1 is 94% and 84% and is 64% and 19% on arm 2 (p = 0.0014). In patients whose digital rectal exam had normalized following treatment and underwent prostate rebiopsy there was a lower positive rebiopsy rate for arm 1 versus arm 2 patients (28 vs. 45%) and also for those with well and moderately differentiated tumors versus poorly differentiated tumors (32 and 50%). These differences were not statistically significant. Grade 1 and 2 rectal bleeding is higher (32 vs. 12%, p = 0.002) as may be urethral stricture (19 vs. 8%, p = 0.07) in the arm 1 versus arm 2. CONCLUSIONS: An increase in prostate tumor dose by external beam of 12.5% to 75.6 CGE by a conformal proton boost compared to a conventional dose of 67.2 Gy by a photon boost significantly improved local control only in patients with poorly differentiated tumors. It has increased late radiation sequelae, and as yet, has not increased overall survival, disease-specific survival, or total recurrence-free survival in any subgroup. These results have led us to test by a subsequent Phase III trial the potential beneficial effect on local control and disease-specific survival of a 12.5% increase in total dose relative to conventional dose in patients with T1, T2a, and T2b tumors

Survival rates, patterns of failure and prognostic factors were evaluated in a retrospective analysis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 116 patients with follicle centre lymphoma stage I and II were treated between 1970 and 1999 in Dresden. Therapy modalities were radiotherapy alone (103 patients) or combined radiotherapy/chemotherapy (13 patients). Radiotherapy was applied as involved-field-(IFI)- (104 patients), extended-field- (nine patients) or total-nodal- (three patients) irradiation. Patients received doses between 25 Gy and 50 Gy (median 35 Gy). RESULTS: The 5- and 10-year actuarial overall survival rates were 76% and 51%. Relapse free survival was 62% and 48% respectively. The median follow-up was 4,0 years. Relapses after complete remission were registered in 44 cases. Six patients have had in-field-recurrences. The majority of out-field-recurrences were nodal relapses (50%). 11% of relapses occurred outside of lymph nodes or were disseminated failures (18%). Significant favorable prognostic factors identified by multivariate and univariate analysis were low age (age < 50 years vs. age > 50 years), low stage and performance of bipedal lymphangiography as primary staging procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Radiotherapy is an effective and tolerable treatment modality for follicle centre lymphoma in the early stages I and II. We registered a high proportion of nodal recurrences, which may be minimized by prophylactic extended radiotherapy

They received total doses of 51-99.2 Gy in fractions of 2-12.5 Gy. All of the tumours responded well to the treatment. All four lesions of Bowen's disease, three of the five oral verrucous carcinomas, and the three squamous cell carcinomas completely regressed following irradiation. Two squamous cell carcinomas recurred during the follow-up period. One recurrent squamous cell carcinoma was successfully treated by a salvage surgical operation, and in the other case the patient refused further therapy. In two verrucous carcinomas there was 90% regression of tumour volume. No severe radiation-related complication occurred. As proton radiotherapy produces good local tumour control without significant morbidity to the surrounding normal tissues, it may prove to be a useful therapeutic modality for the treatment of skin carcinomas

A median dose of 5000 cGy was delivered with 4-6 Mv photons to the tumor bed and regional lymphatics in 9 patients, 1 patient received 2100 cGy to the liver in accelerated fractions because of extensive intrahepatic disease, and 1 patient received 7000 "equivalent" cGy to his pancreatic tumor bed and regional lymphatics with neon heavy particles. An Ir192 wire source later delivered a 3100-10,647 cGy boost to the site of biliary obstruction in each patient, for a mean combined dose of 10,202 cGy to a point 5 mm from the line source. Few acute complications were noted, but 3/11 patients (27%) subsequently developed upper gastrointestinal bleeding from duodenitis or frank duodenal ulceration 4 weeks, 4 months, and 7.5 months following treatment. Eight patients died--5 with local recurrence +/- distant metastasis, 2 with sepsis, and 1 with widespread systemic metastasis. Autopsies revealed no evidence of biliary tree obstruction in 3/3 patients. Mean survival time from initial laparotomy and bypass was 16.1 months, and from radiotherapy completion was 8.3 months. Evolution of radiation treatment techniques for biliary obstruction in the literature is reviewed. High-dose external-beam therapy followed by high-dose Ir192 intracavitary boost is well tolerated and provides significant palliation. Survival of these aggressively managed patients approaches that of patients with primarily resectable tumors

Using carbon beams, a dose escalation study was conducted for the treatment of stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to determine the optimal dose. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The first stage phase I/II trial using 18 fractions over 6 weeks for 47 patients and the second one using nine fractions over 3 weeks for 34 patients were conducted by the dose escalation method from 59.4 to 95.4 Gray equivalents (GyE) in incremental steps of 10% and from 68.4 to 79.2 GyE in 5% increments, respectively. The local control and survival rates were obtained using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Radiation pneumonitis at grade III occurred in three of 81 patients, but they fully recovered. This was not a dose-limiting factor. The local control rates in the first and second trials were 64% and 84%, respectively. The total recurrence rate in both trials was 23.2%. The infield local recurrence in the first trial was significantly dependent on carbon dose. The doses greater than 86.4 GyE at 18 fractions and 72 GyE at nine fractions achieved a local control of 90% and 95%, respectively. The 5 year overall and cause-specific survivals in 81 patients were 42% and 60%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: With our dose escalation study, the optimum safety and efficacy dose of carbon beams was determined. Carbon beam therapy attained almost the same results as surgery for stage I NSCLC although this was a I/II study

DESIGN AND SETTING: Nonrandomized prospective study of a case series in a tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: Nine consecutive patients with newly diagnosed esthesioneuroblastoma or neuroendocrine carcinoma of the paranasal sinuses from June 1992 to October 1995 underwent this treatment protocol. INTERVENTIONS: After histological diagnosis and detailed imaging, 2 cycles of cisplatin and etoposide chemotherapy were instituted. Chemotherapy responders were treated with combined photon and stereotaxic fractionated proton radiation therapy totaling approximately 68 Gy to the primary site, whereas poor responders were treated with surgical resection followed by postoperative radiation. In both cases, therapy was then concluded with 2 additional cycles of cisplatin and etoposide chemotherapy. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Response to therapy, survival, disease-free survival, and complications of therapy were examined. RESULTS: Nine patients with a median Dulguerov T stage of T3 (range, T2 to T4) completed the treatment protocol, with mean follow-up after diagnosis of 20.5 months. Eight of 9 patients exhibited a dramatic response to therapy with remission of their tumor, and resection was not required. One patient failed to respond to induction chemotherapy and received surgical therapy to be followed by postoperative radiotherapy. There have been no recurrences (mean disease-free interval of 14.0 months). Complications were limited and generally transient. CONCLUSIONS: The use of combined cisplatin and etoposide chemotherapy with proton radiation has demonstrated initial success in treatment of these tumors. Dramatic response from chemotherapy is possible even in bulky or unresectable disease. This protocol has an acceptable complication rate and conveys less morbidity than craniofacial resection and conventional radiotherapy. Further follow-up will be required to determine the long-term success rate of this therapeutic protocol

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between September 1998 and April 2002, 16 patients with histopathologically proven ACC and residual macroscopic tumor were treated with combined photon RT and a carbon ion boost to the macroscopic tumor. Median total tumor dose within the gross tumor volume (GTV) was 72 GyE. Photon radiation therapy (RT) consisted of fractionated stereotactic RT in 7 patients; 9 patients received stereotactic intensity-modulated RT. Carbon ion boost was delivered by intensity-controlled raster scanning at the heavy ion synchrotron (SIS) at the Heavy Ion Research Center (GSI) in Darmstadt. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 12 months. Three patients developed locoregional recurrences 9, 11, and 24 months after RT, respectively. Actuarial local control rates were 80.8% and 64.6% at 1 and 3 years, respectively. Overall survival rates were 100% and 83.3% at 1 and 3 years, respectively. Acute side effects greater than Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) Grade 2 were observed in 2 patients; no patient developed late effects > CTC Grade 2. CONCLUSIONS: Combined photon and carbon ion RT is feasible and effective in patients with locally advanced ACC. Acute and late toxicity is moderate with respect to the delivered tumor doses and in accordance with the radiobiologic modeling. A Phase III trial is designed

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The biologic effective dose concept is used to estimate the alpha/beta ratio and K (dose equivalent for tumor repopulation/d) for high-grade glioma patients treated in a randomized fractionation trial. The equivalent radiation dose of temozolomide (Temodar) chemotherapy was estimated from another randomized study. The method assumes that the radiotherapy biologic effective dose is proportional to the adjusted radiotherapy survival duration of high-grade glioma patients. RESULTS: The median tumor alpha/beta and K estimate is 9.32 Gy and 0.23 Gy/d, respectively. Using the published surviving fraction after 2-Gy exposure (SF2) data, and the above alpha/beta ratio, the estimated median alpha value was 0.077 Gy(-1), beta was 0.009 Gy(-2), and the cellular doubling time was 39.5 days. The median equivalent biologic effective dose of temozolomide was 11.03 Gy(9.3) (equivalent to a radiation dose of 9.1 Gy given in 2-Gy fractions). Random sampling trial simulations based on a cure threshold of 70 Gy in high-grade gliomas have shown the potential increase in tumor cure with dose escalation. Partial elimination of hypoxic cells (by chemical hypoxic cell sensitizers or carbon ion therapy) has suggested that considerable gains in tumor control, which are further supplemented by temozolomide, are achievable. CONCLUSION: The radiobiologic parameters for human high-grade gliomas can be estimated from clinical trials and could be used to inform future clinical trials, particularly combined modality treatments with newer forms of radiotherapy. Other incurable cancers should be studied using similar radiobiologic analysis

In this series, the 5-year actuarial locoregional control rate was 41% with a 5-year crude survival rate of 36%. The results are analyzed according to tumour presentation and tumour doses. Six of 15 patients with tumours larger than 6 cm have had a lasting locoregional control. During the same period 43 other patients received radiotherapy as a post-operative modality. Results obtained in this group confirm the previously published data. While recent studies tend to demonstrate the specific efficacy of high LET radiation in the management of locally advanced salivary gland tumours, radical conventional radiotherapy can still be employed with a curative intent when neutron facilities are not available

Doses to the whole liver ranged from 10 to 24 Gray-equivalent (the biological equivalent of 10 to 24 Gray of low-LET photon radiation), whereas the dose to the primary lesion ranged from 53.5 to 70 Gray-equivalent (GyE). The fraction size was 2 to 3 GyE. The liver received partial as well as whole organ irradiation. Integral dose volume histograms for the liver were obtained in all 11 patients. An integral dose volume histogram displays on the ordinate the percentage of liver that was irradiated in excess of the dose specified on the abcissa. In this study, the clinical liver radiation tolerance of these patients is correlated with the information contained in an integral dose volume histogram. One patient developed radiation hepatitis. The integral dose volume histogram of this patient differed from the dose volume histograms of the other 10 patients. This difference was greatest in the range of doses between 30 and 40 GyE. Our results suggest that liver doses in excess of 30 to 35 GyE should be limited to 30% of the liver or less when 18 GyE of whole liver radiation is delivered at 2 GyE per fraction in addition to primary radiation of the pancreas or biliary system

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three children between the ages of 3 and 4 with stage M2 or M3 medulloblastoma were treated between 2001 and 2003 with craniospinal irradiation using protons. Patients received 36 cobalt gray equivalent to the craniospinal axis, then 18 cobalt gray equivalent to the posterior fossa. The cranium was treated with opposed lateral fields. The spine was treated with three matched posteroanterior fields, with the beam stopping just beyond the thecal sac. The posterior fossa was then treated with alternating posteroanterior, right posterior oblique, and left posterior oblique fields, with the beam stopping just proximal to the cochlea. The use of general anesthesia and pre-porting with diagnostic-quality x-rays allowed precise patient positioning. RESULTS: Craniospinal irradiation delivered via conformal proton irradiation substantially reduced the dose to the cochlea and vertebral bodies and virtually eliminated the exit dose through thorax, abdomen, and pelvis. Despite concurrent chemotherapy, a clinically significant lymphocyte count reduction was not seen. Patients tolerated treatment well; acute side effects (e.g., nausea, decreased appetite, and odynophagia) were mild. All patients completed therapy without interruption. CONCLUSION: Our proton-beam technique for craniospinal irradiation of pediatric medulloblastoma has successfully reduced normal-tissue doses and acute treatment-related sequelae. This technique may be especially advantageous in children with a history of myelosuppression, who might not other wise tolerate irradiation

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty-one patients received a second course of PBRT. The mean interval between the first and the second PBRT course was 50.2 months (range, 8-165 months). Most patients (87%) received 70 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE) for both courses. Visual acuity was 20/200 or better in 30 patients initially and in 22 patients at the second treatment. The mean follow-up time after the second treatment was 50 months (range, 6-164 months). RESULTS: At the time of the last follow-up, 20 patients were classified as having no evidence of disease, defined as tumor regression or an absence of tumor progression. Nine eyes (29%) were enucleated because of local recurrence (n = 5) or intractable pain (n = 4). The 5-year eye retention rate was 55% (95% confidence interval: 25.2-77.4). Six of the 22 patients who retained the eye (27%) had useful vision (20/200 or better). CONCLUSIONS: A second course of PBRT for recurrent uveal melanoma to total doses between 118 and 140 CGE was associated with a relatively good probability of local control and a low enucleation rate. Although most patients lost vision, the majority were able to retain the reirradiated eye. Further evaluation is needed to assess metastasis-free survival of additional proton irradiation vs. enucleation after local recurrence

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified 13 STS patients treated with PT between July 1998 and May 2005 in our institutional database. Tumor histology varied with the most common histologic subtypes including liposarcoma and peripheral nerve sheet tumor. All tumors were located in vicinity of critical structures, such as the spinal cord, optic apparatus, bowel, kidney, or bowel. Of the patients, 6 and 5 patients received PT either as adjuvant therapy for non-R0 resection or for recurrence, respectively. Two patients received radical PT for unresectable disease. The median prescribed dose was 69.4 CGE (CGE = proton Gy x 1.1)-Gy (range, 50.4-76.0) at 1.8 to 2 CGE-Gy (median, 1.9) per fraction. Pre-PT anthracycline-based chemotherapy was delivered to 3 patients only. No patient has been lost to follow-up (median 48.1 months, range, 19.1-100.7 months). RESULTS: Of the 13 patients, all but 2 patients were alive. Local recurrence developed in 3 (23%) patients. The administered dose to these patients was < or =60 Gy-CGE. Distant control was achieved in all but 2 patients (lung metastasis), 1 of whom presented with a concomitant local recurrence. The 4-year local control and metastasis-free survival rates were 74.1% and 84.6%, respectively. Late grade > or =2 toxicity was observed in only 2 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Spot scanning PT is an effective and safe treatment for patient with STS in critical locations. The observed toxicity rate was acceptable

This study was designed to evaluate the QOL of disease-freely survival NPC patients after treatment, and to investigate the factors correlated with their QOL. METHODS: From Jul. to Aug. 2003, disease-freely survival NPC patients who had been treated from 1999 to 2000 in Cancer Center of Sun Yat-sen University were enrolled. The Chinese SF-36 questionnaire and a checklist consists of 14 items about self-rating symptoms were self-reported by all participants at clinic. Sociodemographic and clinical data of the patients were also collected, and their relationships with SF-36 data and symptoms were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 192 patients were enrolled in the study. The median survival time was 3.6 years (ranged 2.4-4.6 years). Xerostomia was the first common symptom, followed by hypoacusis, hypomnesia, dysphagia, and trismus. Univariate analysis showed that gender, age, educational level, monthly income, economic status, religion, and the number of complications had influences on QOL; the patients in earlier T and N stages, irradiated by linear accelerator, with lower total dose and weekly dosage to the nasopharynx and neck, and those who had anterior nasal field radiation reported better QOL. Multiple stepwise regression analysis showed that the number of complications, monthly income, age, and T stage were independent factors affecting total QOL. CONCLUSIONS: Improving radiotherapy might enhance physical functions of NPC patients. The prevention and control of chronic diseases, the development of economy, and the increase of income may promote NPC patients' QOL	
0	1900	Proton radiation therapy (PRT) for pediatric optic pathway gliomas: comparison with 3D planned conventional photons and a standard photon technique	Child, Child,Preschool, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Glioma/pa [Pathology], Glioma/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Male, Optic Chiasm, Optic Nerve, Optic Nerve Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Optic Nerve Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Injuries/pc [Prevention & Control], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Risk, Software, Survival, Survival Rate, Temporal Lobe, Universities	PURPOSE: Following adequate therapy, excellent long-term survival rates can be achieved for patients with optic pathway gliomas. Therefore, avoidance of treatment-related functional long-term sequelae is of utmost importance. Optimized sparing of normal tissue is of primary concern in the development of new treatment modalities. The present study compares proton radiation therapy (PRT) with a three-dimensional (3D)-planned multiport photon and a lateral beam photon technique for localized and extensive optic pathway tumors. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between February 1992 and November 1997, seven children with optic pathway gliomas underwent PRT. For this study, we computed proton, 3D photon, and lateral photon plans based on the same CT data sets, and using the same treatment planning software for all plans. Radiation exposure for normal tissue and discrete organs at risk was quantified based on dose-volume histograms. RESULTS: Gross tumor volume (GTV) ranged from 3.9 cm3 to 127.2 cm3. Conformity index (relation of encompassing isodose to GTV volume) was 2.3 for protons, 2.9 for 3D photons, and 7.3 for lateral photons. The relative increase of normal tissue (NT) encompassed at several isodose levels in relation to NT encompassed by the 95% proton isodose volume was computed. Relative NT volume of proton plan isodoses at the 95%, 90%, 80%, 50%, and 25% isodose level increased from 1 to 1.6, 2.8, 6.4, to a maximum of 13.3. Relative volumes for 3D photons were 1.6, 2.4, 3.8, 11.5, and 34.8. Lateral plan relative values were 6, 8.3, 11.5, 19.2, and 26.8. Analysis for small (<20 cm3) and larger (> 80 cm3) tumors showed that protons encompassed the smallest volumes of NT at all isodose levels. Comparable conformity and high-dose gradient were achieved for proton and 3D photon plans in small tumors. However, with increasing tumor volume and complexity, differences became larger. At the 50% isodose level, 3D photons were superior to lateral photons for small tumors; this advantage was equalized for larger tumors. At the lowest isodose level, 3D photons encompassed the highest amount of NT. Analysis of organs at risk showed that PRT reduced doses to the contralateral optic nerve by 47% and 77% compared to 3D photons and lateral photons, respectively. Reductions were also seen for the chiasm (11% and 16%) and pituitary gland (13% and 16%), with differences at clinically relevant tolerance levels. Furthermore, reduced dose exposure of both temporal lobes (sparing 39% and 54%) and frontal lobes was achieved with PRT. CONCLUSION: PRT offered a high degree of conformity to target volumes and steep dose gradients, thus leading to substantial normal tissue sparing in high- and low-dose areas. It is expected that this will result in decreased long-term toxicity in the maturing child. Advantages of proton versus 3D photon plans became increasingly apparent with increasing target size and tumor complexity. Even in small tumors, conformity of 3D photon irradiation came at the expense of a larger amount of NT receiving moderate to low radiation doses. Lateral photons resulted in inferior dose distribution with high radiation exposure of clinically relevant normal tissues

Metastases were diagnosed between 7 weeks and 8.3 years (median, 2.4 years) after proton beam irradiation. Most patients (n = 94) were symptomatic before diagnosis; the remainder were first detected during screening examination. Liver involvement was documented in nearly all patients (n = 136). The majority of patients had died from metastases by the close of the study (n = 137). Significantly longer survival occurred among patients diagnosed during screening examination (P = 0.004) and among young patients (P = 0.03). The majority of patients received some form of treatment for metastases (69%). Median survival was 2.0 months for patients receiving no treatment compared with 5.2 months for those receiving treatment for metastases (P = .0001). However, the overall 1-year survival rate was poor (13%). Prophylactic adjuvant therapy could be explored as a means to increase disease-free survival in patients with uveal melanoma

Proton beam radiotherapy was applied to the lesion, since surgery was contraindicated. The total dose to the stomach lesion was 61 Gy in 7 wk. The tumor on the stomach regressed, with flattening of the round wall of the lesion. The reactive changes of the proton beam radiotherapy, based on the histopathological examination, revealed extensive tumor necrosis and sparing of vital architecture of normal tissue around the irradiated tumor tissue. Only small clusters of vital or devitalized tumor cells with less than approximately 5% of the whole tumor tissue remained after treatment. We suggest that a high dose of radiation delivered by well-defined proton field could result in an improved therapeutic outcome without undue risk of injury to normal tissue

Consequences of treatment are likely to affect the survivor's quality of life significantly. We investigated the feasibility of spot-scanning proton therapy (PT) for soft tissue tumors in childhood. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Sixteen children with soft tissue sarcomas were included. Median age at PT was 3.3 years. In 10 children the tumor histology was embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma. All tumors were located in the head or neck, parameningeal, or paraspinal, or pelvic region. In the majority of children, the tumor was initially unresectable (Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study [IRS] Group III in 75%). In 50% of children the tumors exceeded 5 cm. Fourteen children had chemotherapy before and during PT. Median total dose of radiotherapy was 50 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE). All 16 children were treated with spot-scanning proton therapy at the Paul Scherrer Institute, and in 3 children the PT was intensity-modulated (IMPT). RESULTS: After median follow-up of 1.5 years, local control was achieved in 12 children. Four children failed locally, 1 at the border of the radiation field and 3 within the field. All 4 children died of tumor recurrence. All 4 showed unfavorable characteristic either of site or histopathology of the tumor. Acute toxicity was low, with Grade 3 or 4 side effects according to Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (RTOG/EORTC) criteria occurring in the bone marrow only. CONCLUSIONS: Proton therapy was feasible and well tolerated. Early local control rates are comparable to those being achieved after conventional radiotherapy. For investigations on late effect, longer follow-up is needed

The purpose of this retrospective study is to evaluate the correlation between the final pathologic stage and survival in these patients. METHODS: Patients with biopsy-proven rectal carcinoma, pretreatment staging by magnetic resonance imaging such as T3 or T4 tumors, or node-positive disease were treated with preoperative concomitant 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy and radiation, followed by radical surgical resection. Clinical outcome with survival, disease-free survival, recurrence rate, and local recurrence rate were compared with each T and N findings using the American Joint Committee on Cancer Tumor-Node-Metastasis (TNM) staging system. RESULTS: A total of 248 patients were enrolled in this study. Overall survival and disease-free survival at 1, 3, and 5 years were 97.1, 92, and 89.9% and 87.5, 71.1, and 69.5%, respectively. Thirty-six patients (14.5%) had a pathologic complete response after neoadjuvant therapy. The recurrence rate was significantly different between the pathologic complete response group and residual group (5.6 vs 31.1%; P = .002). Five-year disease-free survival was significantly better in the complete response group than the residual tumor group (93 vs 66%; P = .0045). There was no statistical difference in survival or locoregional recurrence rate between these two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Posttreatment pathologic TNM stage is correlated to disease-free survival and tumor recurrence rate in locally advanced rectal cancer after preoperative chemoradiation. Also, pathologic complete response to neoadjuvant treatment has its oncologic benefit in both overall recurrence and disease-free survival

[Russian]	Facility Design and Construction, Humans, Moscow, Particle Accelerators, Protons, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Research, Time	Since 1969 proton beam therapy of patients with different types of diseases using the ITEP synchrotron proton beam with the energy up to 200 MeV has been conducted in a number of Moscow medical centers. These irradiations employing a specially formed beam are used on a routine basis and are performed in parallel with the program of physical research. Two additional channels as well as two new procedure rooms have been in operation since 1982. A special setup of equipment including clinical dosimetry devices, equipment for patients' irradiation (4 special units), and computer-controlled systems have been installed at the facility. By the present time over 1300 patients have been irradiated. The authors describe physical and dosimetric equipment and irradiation techniques. A summary table containing data on the patients is provided

T2 may be significantly prolonged within 2 h after ingestion of glucose and fructose due to changed water distribution in the melanoma. This method is used to follow melanomas for up to 6 years after proton beam irradiation. In the tumours, T2 was shortened in parallel in all the lesions during the first 9 months. After this, T2 increased only in tumours which showed recurrence. T2 determination and histopathological examination revealed no signs of recurrence in eyes which were enucleated due to neovascular glaucoma. It is concluded that MR imaging performed with carbohydrate loading, registers metabolic changes induced in the tumour, giving this method great validity in the follow-up of choroidal malignant melanoma after irradiation. Eighteen patients treated with proton beam for uveal melanoma at the cyclotron in Uppsala, Sweden, were followed

Twenty-six patients treated for prostate cancer are excluded because of their short follow-up. Local failure developed in 13 of the 78 remaining patients (16.6%)--major complications developed in 4 patients (5.1%). Follow-up has been 1 year to 7 1/2 years; 60/78 patients have been followed for more than 2 years. All local recurrences and complications occurred before 18 months. The device consists of two acrylic cylinders, an acrylic template with an array of holes that serve as guides for trocars, and a cover plate. In use, the cylinders are placed in the vagina and/or rectum or both and then fastened to the template so that a fixed geometric relationship among the tumor volume, normal structures, and source placement is preserved throughout the course of the implantation. Appropriate computer programs have been developed to calculate the dose from these implants. The advantages of the system are (a) greater control of the placement of sources relative to the tumor volume and critical structures, as a result of the fixed geometry provided by the template and cylinders, and (b) improved dose-rate distributions obtained by means of computerized optimization of the source placement and strength during the planning phase. We conclude that the local control rate (83.4%) with low morbidity (5.1%) achieved with the combination of external beam irradiation and MUPIT applicator in these patients with locally advanced malignancies represents an improvement over previous published results with other applicators	
0	4706	Gemcitabine-related radiation recall in a patient with pancreatic cancer	Antimetabolites,Antineoplastic/ae [Adverse Effects], Breast, Combined Modality Therapy, Connecticut, Deoxycytidine/aa [Analogs & Derivatives], Deoxycytidine/ae [Adverse Effects], Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage/et [Etiology], Hematocrit, Humans, Liver, Lung, Male, Middle Aged, Pancreatic Neoplasms/dt [Drug Therapy], Pancreatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Physical Examination, Radiation, Radiation Injuries, Radiation Injuries/pp [Physiopathology], Time, Universities	Radiation recall refers to inflammatory reactions triggered by chemotherapeutic agents and develops cutaneously in the previously irradiated areas. Such agents include anthracyclines, taxanes and capecitabine. Radiation recall related to gemcitabine has been reported in lung and breast cancer. Similar phenomenon associated with gemcitabine, the only FDA-approved drug for pancreatic cancer, is rarely reported. We report a patient with inoperable pancreatic cancer who developed gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to radiation-recall related to gemcitabine and review literature. A 57-year-old white male with unresectable pancreatic cancer received capecitabine in combination with radiation therapy followed by capecitabine alone given over approximately a 3-month time period. Computed tomography re-evaluation demonstrated a new liver lesion. The patient was then treated with gemcitabine and irinotecan. On day 15 of cycle 1, he reported progressive worsening of weakness and fatigue, and melena. Physical examination revealed hypotension (84/47 mmHg) and heme-positive stool on rectal examination. He denied aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use. Chemotherapy was held. Hematocrit was 20% (previously 33%). He was transfused with 3 units of packed red blood cells. An esophago-gastro-duodenal examination was performed which showed antritis and duodenitis consistent with radiation therapy. A single site of oozing was injected with epinephrine. The diffuse gastritis was aggressively treated with proton pump inhibitors. The patient's hematocrit eventually stabilized and was 30% at discharge. Gemcitabine was not resumed. Radiation recall from gemcitabine is rare, but can potentially arise in any site that has been previously irradiated. Gemcitabine should be added to the list of drugs known to cause radiation recall. Treating physicians must be aware of this potential toxicity from gemcitabine either given concomitantly or followed by radiation. We suggest discontinuing gemcitabine if radiation recall is observed. Further studies are warranted into the pathogenesis of this unique phenomenon

A slight but significant difference was noted between the two T categories. Fifty-three patients who were tumour-free 3 to 4 months after irradiation had a 55 per cent survival. No other prognostic parameters were identified on the basis of histologic or radiologic findings. In 14 patients severe radiation complications were observed (bladder 9, small bowel 3, combined 2). In patients with radiation sensitive bladder carcinoma, radical radiation therapy seems to be a comparable alternative to total cystectomy

At the National Institute of Radiological Sciences, patient treatment with the 70 MeV proton beam began in November 1979, and 29 patients were treated through December 1984. Of 11 patients who received protons only, 9 have had local control of the tumor. Two of the 9 patients, suffering from recurrent tumor after radical photon beam irradiation, developed complications after proton treatment. In the patients treated with photons or neutrons followed by proton boost, tumors were controlled in 12 of 18 patients (66.6%), and no complications were observed in this series. Malignant melanoma could not be controlled with the proton beam. A spot-beam-scanning system for protons has been effectively used in the clinical trials to minimize the dose to the normal tissues and to concentrate the dose in the target volume. At the Particle Radiation Medical Science Center, University of Tsukuba, treatment with a vertical 250 MeV proton beam was begun in April 1983, and 22 patients were treated through February 1984. Local control of the tumor was observed in 14 of 22 patients (63.6%), whereas there was no local control in the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme. There have been no severe complications in patients treated at PARMS. The results suggest that local control of tumors will be better with proton beams than with photon beams, whereas additional modalities are required to manage radioresistant tumors

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1999 and 2003, 37 patients were treated in our institution. The indications for PBT were pathologically proven NSCLC, clinical Stage I, tumor size < or =5 cm, medically inoperable or refusal of surgery, and written informed consent. A total dose of 70-94 Gy(E) was delivered in 20 fractions (3.5-4.9 Gy(E) per fraction). RESULTS: Patient characteristics (number of patients) were as follows: Stage IA/IB, 17 of 20; medically inoperable/refusal of surgery, 23/14; total dose 70/80/88/94 Gy(E), 3/17/16/1. With a median follow-up period of 24 months, the 2-year local progression-free and overall survival rates were 80% and 84%, respectively. The 2-year locoregional relapse-free survival rates in Stage IA and Stage IB were 79% and 60%, respectively. No serious acute toxicity was observed. Late Grades 2 and 3 pulmonary toxicities were observed in 3 patients each. Of these 6 patients, 5 had Stage IB disease. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy is a promising treatment modality for Stage I NSCLC, though locoregional relapse and late pulmonary toxicities in Stage IB patients were substantial. Further investigation of PBT for Stage I NSCLC is warranted

Metastases were diagnosed between 7 weeks and 8.3 years (median, 2.4 years) after proton beam irradiation. Most patients (n = 94) were symptomatic before diagnosis; the remainder were first detected during screening examination. Liver involvement was documented in nearly all patients (n = 136). The majority of patients had died from metastases by the close of the study (n = 137). Significantly longer survival occurred among patients diagnosed during screening examination (P = 0.004) and among young patients (P = 0.03). The majority of patients received some form of treatment for metastases (69%). Median survival was 2.0 months for patients receiving no treatment compared with 5.2 months for those receiving treatment for metastases (P = .0001). However, the overall 1-year survival rate was poor (13%). Prophylactic adjuvant therapy could be explored as a means to increase disease-free survival in patients with uveal melanoma

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of proton beam radiation therapy as an alternative to exenteration. METHODS: Twenty patients with extended conjunctival melanoma were treated by proton beam irradiation. Most cases were T3 tumours which were not accessible to brachytherapy due to their extension, localisation with fornical or caruncular involvement. Only 2 patients had a tumour limited to the bulbar conjunctiva. Both were recurrent tumours with multiple lesions. Sixteen cases were recurrences after various pre-treatments. The area of the conjunctiva which was suspected to have microscopic disease was treated by 31 Gy in 6 fractions. The "high risk" areas with a clinically detectable tumour (primary target volume) were treated by an additional boost using a smaller beam size and applying 2 fractions up to 45 Gy. An individually shaped compensator was brought into the beam to modify the range of the protons so that the eye was irradiated only at a depth of 2 mm. RESULTS: The mean follow-up time was 38.1+/-26.6 months (median 34 months). Recurrent disease occurred in 6 cases (30%); 2 of them outside the irradiated volume, 3 within the target volume treated by 31 Gy, and just one in the primary target volume treated by 45 Gy. An exenteration followed only in two patients (10%). 6 patients (30%) suffered from metastatic disease and 4 (20%) of them have died by now. During follow up we found no statistically significant association between the occurrence of local recurrence after proton radiotherapy and the development of metastases. Best corrected visual acuity remained stable in 12 cases (60%); in 14 patients the best corrected visual acuity was 0.25 or better. A sicca-syndrome developed in 19/20 patients. However, only 10/20 patients used artificial tears more than 5x/d. A focal cataract developed in 7 patients (35%). There was eyelash loss in the area of irradiated eyelids. In 4 cases a limbal stem cell deficiency occurred with the consequence of corneal vascularisation. CONCLUSIONS: Proton radiotherapy may serve as an alternative to exenteration in case of T3 and diffuse T1 or T2 conjunctival melanomas

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between December 1995 and December 1999, 17 patients received a treatment by 201-MeV proton beam at the Centre de Protontherapie d'Orsay (CPO) for a meningioma. Five patients presented a histologically atypical or malignant meningioma, twelve patients a benign one that was recurrent or rapidly progressive. In two cases radiotherapy was administered in the initial course of the disease and in 15 cases at the time of relapse. A highly conformal approach was used combining high-energy photons and protons for approximately 2/3 and 1/3 of the total dose. The median total dose delivered within gross tumor volume was 61 Cobalt Gray Equivalent CGE (25-69). RESULTS: Median follow-up was 37 months (17-60). The 4-year local control and overall survival rates were 87.5 +/- 12% and 88.9 +/- 11%, respectively. One patient failed locally within the clinical tumor volume. One patient died of intercurrent disease. A complete or partial clinical improvement was seen in most of patients. Radiologically, there were eleven stable diseases and five partial responses. In 12/15 recurrent cases, the free interval after radiotherapy is longer than that achieved by the initial surgery. This radiotherapy was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: In both benign and more aggressive meningiomas, the combination of conformal photons and protons with a dose escalated by 10-15% offers clinical improvements in most patients as well as radiological long-term stabilization	
1	3162	Linear accelerator-based stereotaxic radiosurgery for brain metastases:the influence of number of lesions on survival	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Brain, Brain Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Brain Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Female, Humans, Karnofsky Performance Status, Life Tables, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Methods, Middle Aged, Necrosis, Particle Accelerators, Predictive Value of Tests, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/ae [Adverse Effects], Radiosurgery/is [Instrumentation], Retrospective Studies, Risk, Survival, Survival Analysis, Time, Treatment Outcome, Universities	PURPOSE: To evaluate the influence of the number of brain metastases on survival after stereotaxic radiosurgery and factors that affect the risk of delayed radiation necrosis after treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between March 1989 and December 1993, 120 consecutive patients underwent linear accelerator-based stereotaxic radiosurgery for brain metastases identified by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The influence of various clinical factors on outcome was assessed using Kaplan-Meier plots of survival from the date of radiosurgery, and univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: The median survival time was 32 weeks. Progressive brain metastases, both local and regional, caused 25 of 104 deaths. Patients with two metastases (n = 30) or a solitary metastasis (n = 70) had equivalent actuarial survival times (P = .07; median, 37 weeks; maximum, 211+ weeks). Patients treated to three or more metastases (n = 20) had significantly shorter survival times (P < .002; median, 14 weeks; maximum, 63 weeks). Prognostic factors associated with prolonged survival included a pretreatment Karnofsky performance status > or = 70% and fewer than three metastases. Delayed radiation necrosis at the treated site developed in 20 patients and correlated with prior or concurrent delivery of whole-brain irradiation and the logarithm of the tumor volume. CONCLUSION: Survival duration is equivalent for patients with one or two brain metastases and is similar to that reported for patients with a solitary metastasis managed by surgical resection and whole-brain irradiation. Survival after radiosurgery for three or more metastases was similar to that reported for whole-brain irradiation

They received total doses of 51-99.2 Gy in fractions of 2-12.5 Gy. All of the tumours responded well to the treatment. All four lesions of Bowen's disease, three of the five oral verrucous carcinomas, and the three squamous cell carcinomas completely regressed following irradiation. Two squamous cell carcinomas recurred during the follow-up period. One recurrent squamous cell carcinoma was successfully treated by a salvage surgical operation, and in the other case the patient refused further therapy. In two verrucous carcinomas there was 90% regression of tumour volume. No severe radiation-related complication occurred. As proton radiotherapy produces good local tumour control without significant morbidity to the surrounding normal tissues, it may prove to be a useful therapeutic modality for the treatment of skin carcinomas

Although this therapeutic modality has been in use for a decade and although nearly 500 patients have been so treated, there are only two published reports of the pathologic examination of these eyes. Key features found on pathologic examination of our patient's enucleated eye included vascular alterations in the tumor's blood supply, lymphocytic infiltrates, and lipoidal degeneration of tumor cells. The interval from therapy to enucleation in our patient was much longer than in the several previously reported cases, a factor allowing for the development of a more cumulative radiation effect on the tumor. The extent and degree of radiation-induced necrosis in our patient's tumor were more profound than in previous reports

In this study we investigate the potential physical advantages of combined photon intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and raster-scanned carbon ion RT over photon IMRT alone. For a representative patient we generated a carbon ion RT plan and a photon IMRT plan. Additionally, combined plans consisting of both carbon ions and photon IMRT were calculated using ratios of 20:40 GyE, 30:30 GyE and 40:20 GyE. The best target coverage was obtained using carbon ions alone. Using a combination of photon IMRT and carbon ions, the target coverage was better than with photon IMRT alone. Due to the applied dose constraints, the sparing of the spinal cord was comparable for all plans. Using carbon ions alone, the non-target tissue volume irradiated to at least 30 GyE/50.4 GyE was reduced by 72%/84% compared to photon IMRT alone. These advantages were evident even with combined techniques. The actually delivered dose distribution is expected to be more dependent on patient misalignment with carbon ions compared with photon IMRT. A combination of carbon ions and photon IMRT might be preferable in order to profit by the physical advantages of carbon ions while ensuring a safe treatment

The role of irradiation and radiation dose levels is poorly defined. This study reviews a single institution experience using both, conventional and high doses > or = 60 Gy/CGE radiation regimen. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1974 and 1995 16 patients with histologically proven malignant meningioma underwent radiation therapy (RT). Age at diagnosis ranged between 6 and 79 years (median: 49 years). Three patients reported previous irradiation to the head at least 14 years prior to diagnosis. Ten patients were treated for primary, and 6 patients for recurrent disease. Six patients underwent gross total and 10 patients subtotal resection (Table 1). RT was delivered using conventional, megavoltage photons or combined 160 MeV proton and photon irradiation. Except 1 patient, who died during RT, the radiation doses ranged between 40 and 70 Gy/CGE (= Cobalt Gray Equivalent) (median: 58 Gy/CGE, Table 2). RESULTS: With median observation time of 59 months (range: 10 to 155 months), actuarial local control rates at 5 and 8 years were 52% and 17%, respectively. Target doses > or = Gy/CGE resulted in significantly improved tumor control (100%) compared to < 60 Gy/CGE (17%) (p = 0.0006, Table 3 and Figure 1). Improved local control translated also in increased overall survival: 87% (> or = 60 Gy/CGE) versus 15% (< 60 Gy/CGE) at 5 years (p = 0.025, Figure 2). At time of analysis, 6/16 patients (38%) were alive. Two patients developed symptomatic brain damage at doses of 59.3 and 72 Gy/CGE. CONCLUSION: Conformal, radiation therapy with target doses > or = 60 Gy/CGE, in this study by use of combined proton and photon irradiation, can significantly improve chances of long-term local control and survival for patients diagnosed with these challenging tumors

The particles utilized have included helium, primarily of interest because of improved dose distributions with reduction of dose to adjacent normal tissues, and heavier particles such as carbon, neon and argon ions which have the additional potential of increased biologic effectiveness against the tumor, especially hypoxic tumor cells. Initial results with helium particles have been sufficiently good to warrant a Phase III randomized trial in carcinoma of the pancreas; in other tumor sites, and with other particles, Phase I -- Phase II studies are in progress. Although follow-up is short, control within the irradiated area in this heterogeneous group of patients appears at least as good as with current megavoltage irradiation and complications to date are acceptably low, warranting further studies with heavy charged particles

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1983 and 1991, 25 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix (stages IIB-IVA) were treated with a curative intent by external photon irradiation to the pelvis, followed by proton irradiation to the primary tumor, delivering a median total tumor dose of 86 Gy (range 71 Gy/26 Fr-101 Gy/46 Fr), and were followed for a median period of 139 months (range 11-184 months). RESULTS: Ten-year overall survival rates for stages IIB and IIIB/IVA patients were 89% and 40%, respectively. Five-year local control rates for stages IIB and IIIB/IVA patients were 100% and 61%, respectively. Four percent of patients experienced severe (Grade 4 or more) late complications in the intestine or urinary bladder at 5 years. CONCLUSION: External photon and proton therapy is effective for those who are not eligible for intracavitary irradiation, and who otherwise have a poor prognosis. The results show that tumor control, survival, and morbidity are similar to those after conventional therapy

Survival rates, patterns of failure and prognostic factors were evaluated in a retrospective analysis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 116 patients with follicle centre lymphoma stage I and II were treated between 1970 and 1999 in Dresden. Therapy modalities were radiotherapy alone (103 patients) or combined radiotherapy/chemotherapy (13 patients). Radiotherapy was applied as involved-field-(IFI)- (104 patients), extended-field- (nine patients) or total-nodal- (three patients) irradiation. Patients received doses between 25 Gy and 50 Gy (median 35 Gy). RESULTS: The 5- and 10-year actuarial overall survival rates were 76% and 51%. Relapse free survival was 62% and 48% respectively. The median follow-up was 4,0 years. Relapses after complete remission were registered in 44 cases. Six patients have had in-field-recurrences. The majority of out-field-recurrences were nodal relapses (50%). 11% of relapses occurred outside of lymph nodes or were disseminated failures (18%). Significant favorable prognostic factors identified by multivariate and univariate analysis were low age (age < 50 years vs. age > 50 years), low stage and performance of bipedal lymphangiography as primary staging procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Radiotherapy is an effective and tolerable treatment modality for follicle centre lymphoma in the early stages I and II. We registered a high proportion of nodal recurrences, which may be minimized by prophylactic extended radiotherapy

The AVM was then treated by proton-beam radiosurgery. Follow-up angiography 2 years later revealed that the AVM had disappeared completely without neurological deficit. The combination of embolization and proton-beam radiosurgery was curative in this patient with a pontine AVM associated with an aneurysm on the feeding artery, showing that these techniques can be used to treat inoperable vascular lesions safely

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-one patients with Stage I NSCLC (11 with Stage IA and 10 with Stage IB) underwent hypofractionated high-dose proton beam therapy. At the time of irradiation, patient age ranged from 51 to 85 years (median, 74 years). Nine patients were medically inoperable because of comorbidities, and 12 patients refused surgical resection. Histology was squamous cell carcinoma in 6 patients, adenocarcinoma in 14, and large cell carcinoma in 1. Tumor size ranged from 10 to 42 mm (median, 25 mm) in maximum diameter. Three and 18 patients received proton beam irradiation with total doses of 50 Gy and 60 Gy in 10 fractions, respectively, to primary tumor sites. RESULTS: Of 21 patients, 2 died of cancer and 2 died of pneumonia at a median follow-up period of 25 months. The 2-year overall and cause-specific survival rates were 74% and 86%, respectively. All but one of the irradiated tumors were controlled during the follow-up period. Five patients showed recurrences 6-29 months after treatment, including local progression and new lung lesions outside of the irradiated volume in 1 and 4 patients, respectively. The local progression-free and disease-free rates were 95% and 79% at 2 years, respectively. No therapy-related toxicity of Grade > or =3 was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Hypofractionated high-dose proton beam therapy seems feasible and effective for Stage I NSCLC. Proton beams may contribute to enhanced efficacy and lower toxicity in the treatment of patients with Stage I NSCLC

Fifty-two out of 249 patients accepted for pion treatment by the end of 1986 were treated for malignant glioma with high dose pion irradiation. A substantial influence of their radioresistance was expected from increased radiation quality due to the contribution of high LET particles from pion capture, and by the possibility of target volume shaping and dose distribution related to the dynamic spot-scan conformation technique. The patients' treatment followed a dose escalation program with total doses from 2720-3420 cGy, fraction sizes from 170 to 205 cGy (90% isodose, minimum target dose), and treatment times from 4 to 5 weeks. 12/52 patients received an accelerated treatment with 3280 cGy in 14-22 days. 49/52 patients are eligible: 3 with astrocytoma of clinical aggressive behaviour, 14 with anaplastic astrocytoma (median age 42 years), and 32 patients with glioblastoma (median age 52 years). 8/49 patients had total/subtotal tumour resection, 19 patients a stereotactic biopsy. The patients were divided into three groups according to total dose, and a fourth group which received the accelerated treatment. There was no statistically significant difference in the median survival rate between the four groups, which was 13 months for the non-glioblastoma patients and 9 months for the glioblastoma patients. No radiation necrosis and no demyelination was found in 17 patients (6 recraniotomies, 11 autopsies). In 10/17 patients, clearly identifiable tumour cells were not demonstrated. NMR findings showed the tumour-surrounding oedema mostly stimulated by tumour necrosis and tumour progression. From these findings, further dose escalation programs, together with a shaping of the target volume close to the tumour, are not contraindicated

All patients were examined with standardized A and B scan ultrasonography before and after treatment with proton beam irradiation therapy. The follow-up was carried out at 1, 3, 5, 8 months and then every 6 months. The mean follow-up was 20 months (range 6-34 months). The thickness of the tumors was demonstrated to be decreased and the internal reflectivity to be enhanced in 9 out of 10 cases from 8 months after treatment till the end of the follow-up period. Histopathology confirmed in 1 eye enucleated 5 months after treatment that medium-low internal reflectivity coresponded with several areas of high cellularity and cellular mitosis. The results of our study indicate the reliability of standardized A and B scan echography in the follow-up of PCMM treated with proton beam irradiation therapy

The proximity of both kidneys and the liver, and a more complex target configuration, can pose a dosimetric challenge for conventional X-ray treatment and intraoperative irradiation. We utilized proton radiation therapy (PRT) to reduce dose to uninvolved kidneys, liver, intestine, and spinal cord. PROCEDURE: A 4-year-old male underwent PRT for neuroblastoma of the right adrenal gland, following chemotherapy and delayed surgical resection. Clinical target volume (CTV), boost volume, and normal structures were outlined on the 3D treatment planning CT scan. The patient received 25.2 CGE (cobalt Gray equivalent) to the CTV and 34.2 CGE to the boost region, using 1.8 CGE per fraction, five treatments per week. Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) were obtained for target and nontarget structures. RESULTS: The 95% isodose volume enclosed CTV and boost volumes. The dose to 50% of the ipsilateral kidney, with tumor involvement of the medial renal surface, was < or = 16 CGE (47% of prescribed total dose). Doses to 50% and 20% of the contralateral kidney in close proximity to deep left-side, paraspinal soft tissue involvement were restricted to 1 CGE and 10 CGE, respectively. Eighty percent of the liver received 27 CGE (80% of prescribed dose). Using a patch technique, unique to charged particle therapy, the spinal cord was almost completely spared during boost volume irradiation. CONCLUSIONS: PRT can achieve excellent dose conformity for advanced retroperitoneal, paraspinal lesions, while respecting normal tissue tolerance levels. Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc

The optimal therapeutic management is unclear but, in general, this tumour is treated with surgery followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Proton beam radiation therapy (PT) offers superior dose distributional qualities compared with X- or gamma rays, as the dose deposition occurs in a modulated narrow zone called the Bragg peak. As a result, organs at risk are optimally speared. Here, we present a patient treated with the first spinal axis segment irradiation using spot-scanning PT with a single field, combined with conventional cranio-spinal axis radiotherapy after surgery and chemotherapy, and an extensive review of the literature outlining the clinical features and treatment modality of spinal PNET.

METHODS: Between May 1998 and April 2004, 11 patients (four were recurrences because they previously had been treated with surgery and/or radiotherapy) underwent transnasal transsphenoidal endoscopic surgery for cranial base chordomas and chondrosarcomas at the Neurosurgical Department of Bellaria Hospital in Bologna. The transsphenoidal endoscopic approach and the ethmoid-pterygo-sphenoidal endoscopic approach were used to accomplish resection of the lesions involving the clivus and extending up to the parasellar region and to the petrous apex, or within the cavernous sinus. RESULTS: Patient follow-up periods ranged from 15 to 69 months (mean, 27 mo). Three patients died of chordoma progression at 20, 14, and 10 months, respectively, after endoscopic treatment. One patient experienced two recurrences; the first was treated using a new endoscopic approach, whereas the second, 1 year later, was treated by means of a far lateral approach. Four patients underwent postoperative proton beam radiotherapy, whereas one underwent a conventional megavoltage x-radiation therapy. However, postoperative radiotherapy was not administered in the two patients treated for cranial base chondrosarcoma. CONCLUSION: The flexibility of this new technique with respect to the classical microscopic transsphenoidal approach permits us to widen the horizon of surgical management of aggressive cranial base tumors such as clival chordomas and chondrosarcomas

The potential of proton beam RT as an alternative to conventional brachytherapy was evaluated. Except for one local recurrence, 14 of 15 patients were locoregionally controlled for 15 to 57 months. Two-year local control rate and 2-year survival rate were 92.3% and 93.3%, respectively. Two cases of transient, radiation-induced proctitis (neither of which required surgical treatment) were the only complications despite a target dose that exceeded 8000 cGy in most cases. The results suggest that sharply localized, high-dose proton beam RT can produce an antitumor effect equivalent to that of conventional brachytherapy

There were 14 men and 12 women, with a mean age of 39.6 years. Six patients had chondroid chordomas. The most common presenting symptoms were headache and diplopia, and the most common presenting sign was extraocular palsy. Fifty-three operations directed at removal of the tumor were performed. Twenty-three patients received various forms of radiation therapy postoperatively, including conventional external beam therapy, heavy charged particles, and interstitial implants. The average length of follow-up is 5.6 years. Eleven of 26 patients have died; the mean duration of survival in this group, excluding 1 perioperative death, was 4 years and 2 months. Although the average survival time of 6 years and 4 months was the same in patients with typical chordomas (excluding the perioperative death and 1 patient lost to follow-up) and in those with the chondroid variant, all of the latter are still alive, whereas more than half of the patients with typical chordoma have died

After treatment by heavy ion beam therapy, pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy was performed. The tumor was pT3, pN0, pM0, stage IIA. Sixteen months after the surgery, the patient was admitted to the hospital because he was vomiting blood. Hemorrhaging caused by failure of the cut end of the gastroduodenal artery into the elevated jejunum was confirmed by angiogram, and the hemorrhaging could be stopped by a transcatheter arterial embolization operation. Twenty-four months after surgery, the patient was readmitted because he was once again vomiting blood. Hemorrhaging from the elevated jejunum was suspected by hemorrhagic scintigram, but the source could not be identified on further examination, and the choice of treatment was difficult. The patient died on the 9th day after admittance to the hospital. Even on examination at autopsy, the source of the hemorrhaging could not be identified. No recurrence of cancer could be found. This has proven to be a perplexing case, in that hemorrhaging from the end of the routinely cut gastroduodenal artery occurred 16 and 24 months after heavy ion beam therapy and pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy for pancreatic cancer

[Review] [23 refs] [Russian]	Chordoma, Head, Humans, Melanoma, Neck, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Sarcoma, Skull, Universities	Investigations in proton beam therapy of cancer patients have been initiated at the Cyclotron Laboratory, Harvard University, Cambridge, USA, since 1974 using a proton beam with the energy of 160 MeV for fractionated irradiation of uveal melanoma (899 cases), chordoma and chondrosarcoma of the base of the skull (96), sarcoma of the soft tissues and bones (79), prostatic cancer, head and neck tumors, etc. (altogether 1331 patients had been irradiated by June, 1986). To stop a beam in the target computer-assisted three-dimensional design and heterogeneity calculations were performed; computed compensatory boles were produced. Proton beam therapy is used alone or in combination with proton beam irradiation, routine radiotherapy. Areas of particular interest are ocular melanoma, chordoma and chondrosarcoma of the base of the skull, paraspinal sarcomas. Investigations in the field of proton beam therapy of malignant meningioma, metastases to the paraaortic lymph nodes hold promise. [References: 23]

METHODS: A clinical technique to provide reproducible breast immobilization was developed. Breast immobilization begins by fitting each patient with a treatment brassiere. Patients are placed prone in a cylindrical polyvinyl chloride shell with the upper and lower body being supported and immobilized with Vac-Lok foam bead cushions. The upper chest and breast areas are immobilized with two-part expandable foam. After a treatment planning computed tomography scan, the lumpectomy cavity is outlined, and a clinical target volume is generated by adding 1cm in all dimensions. A three-dimensional treatment plan is developed with treatment typically given with 2 to 4 separate proton beams. The dose administered is 40 cobalt Gray equivalents (CGE) delivered in 10 daily fractions of 4 CGE with multiple fields treated each day. Proton and conformal x-ray plans were compared using dose-volume histogram analysis to determine volumes of normal breast tissue and skin treated with each technique. RESULTS: An institutional review board-approved clinical trial was developed using this technique, and 20 patients have completed treatment. All subjects were able to undergo the immobilization procedure and daily treatments without significant discomfort, and no treatment interruptions were encountered. There was no evidence of respiratory motion identified on treatment planning CT images or on daily set-up radiographs. Acute toxicity has been limited to occasional radiation dermatitis (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group grade 1-2). Proton plans were compared with 2 methods of photon partial breast irradiation, including reduced tangential fields and five-field conformal techniques. Ten treatment plans with dose-volume histogram analysis revealed that the use of proton beams provided a significant reduction in doses to the ipsilateral breast and skin while eliminating doses to the heart and lung tissues. CONCLUSIONS: A simple immobilization procedure provides accurate and reproducible breast positioning while simultaneously eliminating respiratory motion. The procedure has been well tolerated by the first 20 patients. Protons can provide substantial normal tissue protection compared with the use of conformal x-rays when used for partial breast treatment. We plan to continue enrollment and analyze long-term toxicity, local control, and survival

Cirrhotic patients were eligible if they had a Child-Pugh score of 10 or less. Eligible patients included those with T 1 -T 3 hepatocellular carcinoma; selected T 4 patients also were eligible. Patients with lymph node or distant metastases were ineligible. Daily proton beam radiotherapy was directed to the liver tumor with an additional 1-2 cm margin. The total dose was 63 cobalt Gray equivalents, administered in 15 divided fractions over 3 weeks. Thirty-four patients have completed treatment and have been followed up for a minimum of 6 months, with a median follow-up period of 20 months. The mean age was 65 years, and average tumor size was 5.7 cm. Posttreatment toxicity included a small but significant decline in albumin levels and increased total bilirubin; 3 experienced duodenal or colonic bleeding when bowel was immediately adjacent to the treated tumor. Two-year actuarial data showed a 75% local tumor control rate and an overall survival rate of 55%. Of patients with an elevated pretreatment alpha-fetoprotein, 85% were found to have declining alpha-fetoprotein levels from a pretreatment mean of 1405 to 35 at 6 months after treatment. Six patients underwent liver transplantation between 6 and 16 months after completion of radiotherapy with 2 showing no evidence of residual carcinoma within the explanted liver. Overall the majority of patients responded to treatment, and the therapy was well tolerated

A median dose of 5000 cGy was delivered with 4-6 Mv photons to the tumor bed and regional lymphatics in 9 patients, 1 patient received 2100 cGy to the liver in accelerated fractions because of extensive intrahepatic disease, and 1 patient received 7000 "equivalent" cGy to his pancreatic tumor bed and regional lymphatics with neon heavy particles. An Ir192 wire source later delivered a 3100-10,647 cGy boost to the site of biliary obstruction in each patient, for a mean combined dose of 10,202 cGy to a point 5 mm from the line source. Few acute complications were noted, but 3/11 patients (27%) subsequently developed upper gastrointestinal bleeding from duodenitis or frank duodenal ulceration 4 weeks, 4 months, and 7.5 months following treatment. Eight patients died--5 with local recurrence +/- distant metastasis, 2 with sepsis, and 1 with widespread systemic metastasis. Autopsies revealed no evidence of biliary tree obstruction in 3/3 patients. Mean survival time from initial laparotomy and bypass was 16.1 months, and from radiotherapy completion was 8.3 months. Evolution of radiation treatment techniques for biliary obstruction in the literature is reviewed. High-dose external-beam therapy followed by high-dose Ir192 intracavitary boost is well tolerated and provides significant palliation. Survival of these aggressively managed patients approaches that of patients with primarily resectable tumors

Having two treatment ion beams(proton and carbon) and five treatment rooms, it is a pioneer among particle institutes worldwide. In May 2001, proton therapy was started as a clinical study for patients with localized cancer originating in the head and neck, lung, liver, and prostate. The aim of this study was to investigate the safety, effectiveness, and stability of the treatment units and systems based on the evaluation of acute toxicity, tumor response, and working ratio of the machine, respectively. Six patients, including liver cancer in three, prostate cancer in two, and lung cancer in one, were treated. There was no cessation of therapy owing to machine malfunction. Full courses of proton therapy consisting of 154 portals in all six patients were given exactly as scheduled. None of the patients experienced severe acute reactions of more than grade 3 according to NCI-CTC criteria. Tumor response one month post-treatment was evaluable in five of the six patients, and was CR in 1 (prostate cancer), PR in 2 (lung cancer: 1, liver cancer: 1), and NC in 2(liver cancer: 2). These results indicate that our treatment units and systems are safe and reliable enough for proton irradiation to be used for several malignant tumors localized in the body	
1	1562	An optimization algorithm that incorporates IMRT delivery constraints	Algorithms, Head, Humans, Male, Models,Statistical, Particle Accelerators/is [Instrumentation], Physics, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,Conformal/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Rectum, Research, Risk	An intensity-modulated beam optimization algorithm is presented which incorporates the delivery constraints into the optimization cycle. The optimization algorithm is based on the quasi-Newton method of iteratively solving minimization problems. The developed algorithm iteratively corrects the incident, pencil-beam-like, fluence to incorporate the delivery constraints. In the present study, the goal of the optimization algorithm is to achieve the best deliverable radiotherapy plan, subject to the constraints of the delivery technique described by a leaf-sequencing algorithm being applied concurrently. In general, if they are applied after, rather than during, the optimization cycle, the delivery constraints associated with the IMRT technique can produce local variations up to 6% in the 'optimized' dose (i.e., distribution without applied constraints) and reduce the degree of conformity, of the dose, to the PTV region. The optimization method has been applied to three IMRT delivery techniques: dynamic multileaf (DMLC), multiple-static-field (MSF) and slice-by-slice tomotherapy (NOMOS MIMiC). The beam profiles were generated for a prostate tumour with organs at risk being the rectum, bladder and femoral heads. The optimization method described was shown to generate optimum and deliverable IMRT plans for these three delivery techniques. In the case of the DMLC and MSF the optimization converged within 3-5 iterations to a mean PTV dose of 69.60 +/- 1.34 Gy and 69.71 +/- 1.34 Gy, respectively, while for NOMOS MIMiC approximately 10 iterations were needed to obtain 69.68 +/- 1.55 Gy. In addition to this, the IMRT optimization also yielded optimum fluence profiles when clustering was performed concurrently with the leaf-sequencer. An optimum between 8 and 15 clusters of equal fluence 'intensity' was shown to establish the best compromise between the number of fluence levels and the PTV dose coverage

Proton irradiation of ocular melanoma requires an accurate assessment of all tumour margins. The tumour is marked surgically by suturing to the sclera four or five tantalum rings on the borders of the tumour defined by transillumination. In order to evaluate the clinical usefulness of high-frequency ultrasound imaging, four and five rings were surgically placed in a patient with an iris/ciliary body melanoma and in a patient with ciliochoroidal melanoma using transillumination to localize the tumour margins. Subsequently margins were verified by HFUI. In the first patient, the distances between the rings and the limbus were measured using calipers during surgery and were compared with HFUI measurements and measurements from planning software. The distances were comparable within 0.5 mm. In the second patient the treatment was planned in two different ways using EYEPLAN software. In the first scenario the shape of the tumour and its relation to the rings were obtained from the surgeon's mapping, the fundus drawing using a transilluminating point light source, and the HFUI. In the second scenario, the shape of the tumour was deduced from the ring positions only. It was observed that the maximum difference between the tumour edge as seen on high-frequency ultrasound images and the rings was 2.6 mm. The tumour volume was underestimated by 39% when tumour shape was obtained from ring positions only. During the past year we have utilized HFUI in 18 patients having tumours involving the anterior segment of the eye, among which four were treated with proton therapy. In conclusion, we believe that high-frequency ultrasound imaging provides additional information with respect to the location of tumour margins in ciliary body and anterior uveal melanoma. Occult extension of the tumour within the ciliary body or posterior iris may not be appreciated by transillumination alone

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed 30 proton plans for 15 patients who underwent CT and MRI scans with an RB or water alone. Simulation was performed with a modified MRI endorectal coil and an RB with 100 mL of water or water alone. Doses of 78-82 gray equivalents were prescribed to the planning target volume. The two groups were compared for three structures: rectum, rectal wall (RW), and rectal wall 7 cm (RW7) at the level of the planning target volume. RESULTS: Rectum and RW volumes radiated to low, intermediate, and high doses were small: rectum V10, 33.7%; V50, 17.3%; and V70, 10.2%; RW V10, 32.4%; V50, 20.4%; and V70, 14.6%. The RB effectively increased the rectal volume for all cases (139.8 +/- 44.9 mL vs. 217.7 +/- 32.2 mL (p < 0.001). The RB also decreased the volume of the rectum radiated to doses V10-V65 (p < or = 0.05); RW for V10-V50; and RW7 for V10-V35. An absolute rectum V50 improvement >5% was seen for the RB in 5 of 15 cases, for a benefit of 9.2% +/- 2.3% compared with 2.4% +/- 1.3% for the remaining 10 cases (p < 0.001). Similar benefit was seen for the rectal wall. No benefit was seen for doses > or =70 gray equivalents for the rectum, RW, or RW7. No benefit of < or =1% was seen with an RB in 46% for the rectum V70 and in 40% for the rectal wall V70. CONCLUSIONS: Rectum and rectal wall doses with proton radiation were low whether using water or an RB. Selected patients will have a small but significant advantage with an RB; however, water alone was well tolerated and will be an alternative for most patients	
0	891	Preliminary assessment of magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging in predicting treatment outcome in patients with prostate cancer at high risk for relapse.[see comment]	Disease-Free Survival, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Male, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local, Neoplasm Staging, Physics, Predictive Value of Tests, Prognosis, Prostate, Prostate-Specific Antigen, Prostatectomy, Prostatic Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Radiation, Research, Risk, Risk Assessment, Sensitivity and Specificity, Treatment Outcome	The purpose of the study was to determine whether 3D proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) can predict treatment outcome in high risk patients with prostate cancer. Endorectal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 1H-MRSI were performed in 16 patients with prostate cancer who were considered high risk because of clinical stage T3-4, Gleason score>/=8, and/or prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level>20 ng/mL. Patients were treated with chemotherapy/hormone therapy, underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) or radiation therapy, and were followed for PSA relapse (follow-up, 19-43 months). The ratio of choline plus creatine to citrate was used to localize peripheral zone cancer. An MRSI risk score on a scale of 0-3 was derived from the volume and degree of metabolic abnormality. Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging risk score, MRI tumor/node (TN) stage, clinical stage, Gleason score, and PSA were used as predictors of pathologic stage in patients treated with RP (n=10) and PSA relapse in all patients. Magnetic resonance imaging TN stage (P<0.01) and MRSI risk score (P<0.05) correlated with pathologic stage, but clinical stage did not (P=0.35). Magnetic resonance imaging TN stage was the only significant predictor of PSA relapse in the univariate analysis (P<0.05). Although the MRSI risk score did not reach significance (P=0.13), 6 patients with a score<0.9 were relapse-free, whereas 7 of 10 patients with a score>0.9 relapsed. Magnetic resonance imaging and MRSI risk assessments agreed in 15 of 16 patients. These preliminary results suggest that tumor metabolic assessment may indicate treatment outcome in high-risk patients with prostate cancer. Although MRSI did not provide added prognostic value to MRI in this small number of patients, MRSI might increase the confidence of the clinician in assessing risk on MRI by contributing supporting metabolic data

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four hydrogen-1 MR spectroscopic imaging studies were performed in a patient with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) before, during, and after radiation therapy and at follow-up at 33 months after diagnosis of the recurrence of disease. The patient had a single, large lesion in the brain and underwent hyperfractionated radiation therapy for 4 weeks. A series of MR images was also obtained. RESULTS: The pretreatment study showed a lesion with a distinct spectral pattern: marked elevation of choline and lipids and great reduction of creatine and N-acetylaspartate. During and after treatment, H-1 MR spectroscopic images depicted a progressive reduction of the abnormal choline and lipid signals. Thirty-three months after treatment, multiple-section H-1 MR spectroscopic images showed normal spectral patterns in all sections examined. CONCLUSION: H-1 MR spectroscopy may contribute to the neuroradiologic evaluation of NHL and, in particular, may be useful in monitoring therapeutic response

The performance of the unit and different variants of dosimetric therapeutic plans of the fast electron beam are presented. Electron therapy with the energy of 6 MeV was mostly used in patients with head and neck tumors. Intra-oral irradiation with fast electrons was given to 4 patients with cancer of the moving part of the tongue and 5 patients with cancer of the fundic oral mucosa, the soft palate and the buccal mucosa in the form of combined or concomitant therapy. Summary focal doses in irradiation with fast electrons were 45-63 Gy for a combined or radical therapeutic course. A noticeable tumor regression was observed in patients with cancer of the skin, vermilion border and breast cancer recurrences. Though there were very few cases the results of concomitant and combined radiotherapy of cancer of the oral mucosa were promising. The first results of clinical application of the small-size PMB-6E betatron have shown its high efficacy for the treatment of superficial tumors

On the other hand, carbon-ion beam therapy is giving good results in some selected carcinoma such as small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, uterus cancer, and soft tissue/bone tumor. In this report, we discuss four patients with pancreatic cancer treated by surgical pancreatectomy combined with preoperative carbon-ion beam irradiation. All patients were irradiated with 48 GyE carbon-iron beam by HIMAC (Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba) to the pancreatic area including lymph nodes and nerve plexus. Severe cholangitis, as the postoperative complication, had occurred in one of the patients. However, there was no complication or disorder caused by carbon-iron radiation. All four patients are alive now, but two of them developed tumor recurrence, one with hepatic metastasis and the other with peritoneal dissemination. Surgical treatment for pancreatic cancer combined with preoperative carbon-ion irradiation is expected as a promising cure, but it is necessary to examine more cases in the future to evaluate the clinical outcome of this treatment

The rate of recurrence is particularly high in cases of large size tumor, of widespread tumors and with PAM associated lesions. Tumor recurrences have a bad long-term prognostic significance and often necessitate exenteration. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A method of therapy combining total surgical excision with proton-beam irradiation, cobalt plaque irradiation and cryotherapy is described. This technique is used in particular unfavorable cases with the aim of lowering the rate of recurrences. It was practiced in 19 cases in Lausanne, 10 of which were recurrent tumors. The melanoma invaded 3 quadrants of the bulbar conjunctiva in 8 cases and 4 quadrants in 11 cases. At least one neighbouring tarsal conjunctiva was invaded in 11 cases and both in 7 cases. The skin of the eyelid was infiltrated in 6 cases and the caruncle in 9 cases. Tumor thickness was 1 to 2 mm in 8 cases, 3 to 4 mm in 4 cases and 5 to 10 mm in 7 cases. RESULTS: PAM was present in 16 cases. Follow-up period was less than 1 year in 2 cases, between 1 to 2 years in 5 cases, between 2 to 3 years in 5 cases and more than 3 years in 7 cases. 5 patients had lymph node metastases, 3 died of metastatic disease and 2 had a local recurrence. One of these recurrences was small-sized and was excised, the other was widespread and the patient died soon with metastatic disease. No exenteration was performed. CONCLUSION: The method of therapy that is here described appears to be a valuable alternative to exenteration of the orbit for the treatment of diffuse or large-size conjunctival melanomas which have a high risk of local recurrence	
0	2763	Stereotactic single high dose radiation therapy of benign intracranial meningiomas	Adult, Aged, Brain, Female, Humans, Male, Meningeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Meningioma/rt [Radiotherapy], Methods, Middle Aged, Necrosis, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiosurgery, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Recurrence, Research, Stereotaxic Techniques, Time, Tungsten, Universities	Seventeen patients with intracranial meningiomas were treated with single high dose irradiation at the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg. Indications for radiosurgery included unresected tumors, gross disease remaining despite surgery, and recurrences. Therapy was carried out by a technique using multiple non-coplanar arc irradiations from a 15 MeV linear accelerator. This technique coupled with secondary tungsten collimators allowed a high concentration of the dose in the target volume with an extremely steep dose gradient at the field borders. The patients were treated with a single irradiation dose ranging from 10 to 50 Gy (mean of 29 Gy). Four of 17 patients died: one death was tumor-related and not attributable to the treatment, one died of a treatment related complication, and two patients died of intercurrent diseases. The remaining 13 of the 17 patients with a median follow-up time of 40 months have no evidence of tumor relapse. Late severe side effects include five patients with a large area of brain edema, three of which were concurred with tumor necrosis. We conclude from these initial data that single high doses of irradiation concentrated to the tumor volume by stereotaxic methods can achieve local tumor control. It is also clear from these data that the effective therapeutic dose range must be better defined

Currently published studies use IMRT only in the treatment of the primary tumor. In these studies, the lymph nodes of the neck were treated using conventional techniques. The feasibility of an IMRT technique which allows treatment of the complete target volume, including the primary tumor and lymph nodes, without a beam split is described. PATIENT AND METHOD: For inverse treatment planning, the KonRad planning system was used. The primary as well as the secondary PTV (bilateral lymph node levels) were treated with one intensity-modulated primary plan. To increase the dose in the primary PTV and suspicious lymph nodes, an intensity-modulated boost plan was performed. The "step and shoot" IMRT technique was used. A plan comparison between the described IMRT approach and an IMRT approach using a split-beam technique was performed focusing on the treatment time. A patient with a carcinoma of the nasopharynx was treated with curative intent by a combined radiochemotherapy. RESULTS: The median total dose to the primary PTV was 70 Gy, to suspicious lymph nodes > or = 66.0 Gy, and to the secondary PTV 52 Gy. The defined maximum doses to the organs at risk were not exceeded, and the median dose to the protected parotid gland amounted to 21 Gy. Comparison of the treatment time between both IMRT approaches revealed only a slightly shorter treatment time (1-3 min) for the split-beam IMRT technique without considering the remaining conventional treatment parts of the split-beam IMRT technique. The patient achieved a complete response, and 18 months after treatment no signs of recurrent disease are visible. CONCLUSIONS: IMRT allows the treatment of the target volumes with high doses combined with an excellent sparing of the organs at risk. The IMRT approach presented here makes the treatment of the whole target volume with a single-beam arrangement feasible and does not increase the treatment time compared to a split-beam IMRT technique. Treatment time was comparable to a conventional three-field technique combined with electrons. This IMRT technique can prevent over- or underdosage at field matchlines in the head and neck region and, moreover, is able to spare parotid glands and therefore better avoid xerostomia compared to conventional techniques	
0	639	Proton radiotherapy for orbital rhabdomyosarcoma: clinical outcome and a dosimetric comparison with photons	Brain/re [Radiation Effects], Child, Child,Preschool, Female, Humans, Infant, Male, Massachusetts, Orbital Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Rhabdomyosarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy]	BACKGROUND: Over 85% of pediatric orbital rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) are cured with combined chemotherapy and radiation. However, the late effects of photon radiation compromise function and cosmetic outcome. Proton radiation can provide excellent tumor dose distributions while sparing normal tissues better than photon irradiation. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Conformal 3D photon and proton radiotherapy plans were generated for children treated with proton irradiation for orbital RMS at Massachusetts General Hospital. Dose-volume histograms (90%, 50%, 10%) were generated and compared for important orbital and central nervous system structures. Average percentages of total dose prescribed were calculated based on the 3 dose-volume histogram levels for normal orbital structures for both the proton and photon plans. The percent of normal tissue spared by using protons was calculated. RESULTS: Seven children were treated for orbital rhabdomyosarcoma with proton irradiation and standard chemotherapy. The median follow-up is 6.3 years (range, 3.5-9.7 years). Local and distant controls compare favorably to those in other published accounts. There was an advantage in limiting the dose to the brain, pituitary, hypothalamus, temporal lobes, and ipsilateral and contralateral orbital structures. Tumor size and location affect the degree of sparing of normal structures. CONCLUSIONS: Fractionated proton radiotherapy is superior to 3D conformal photon radiation in the treatment of orbital RMS. Proton therapy maintains excellent tumor coverage while reducing the radiation dose to adjacent normal structures. Proton radiation therapy minimizes long-term side effects

The treatment volumes for 13 NSCLC patients undergoing radical radiotherapy were planned using the five different techniques and dose-volume histograms (DVH) were used extensively in the comparative analysis. The minimum dose to the phase 2 target volume was escalated to 90 Gy, or until the point at which pre-set tolerance limits of spinal cord or lung were exceeded. The proton plan could treat nine of the 13 patients up to a dose of 90 Gy. Among the four X-ray techniques, performance varied enormously. One of them could not treat any of the patients, even to the conventional 60 Gy level, without failing to meet one or more of the criteria, whilst another one could treat 10 out of the 13 patients, although with this technique only four were permitted to have the dose escalated to 90 Gy. It was also found that two of the 13 patients could not be treated by any of the proton or X-ray plans to the conventional level, and were therefore considered unsuitable for radical radiotherapy. Various issues in conformal NSCLC radiotherapy including organ movement, tumour control, other possible organs at risk etc., are also discussed	
0	676	Treatment planning with protons for pediatric retinoblastoma, medulloblastoma, and pelvic sarcoma: how do protons compare with other conformal techniques?

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The tumor volumes from 8 patients (3 retinoblastomas, 2 medulloblastomas, and 3 pelvic sarcomas) were studied retrospectively to compare DVHs from proton therapy with 3D-CRT, electron therapy, and IMRT. In retinoblastoma, several planning techniques were analyzed: A single electron appositional beam was compared with a single 3D-CRT lateral beam, a 3D-CRT anterior beam paired with a lateral beam, IMRT, and protons. In medulloblastoma, three posterior fossa irradiation techniques were analyzed: 3D-CRT, IMRT, and protons. Craniospinal irradiation (which consisted of composite plans of both the posterior fossa and craniospinal components) was also evaluated, primarily comparing spinal irradiation using 3D-CRT electrons, 3D-CRT photons, and protons. Lastly, in pelvic sarcoma, 3D-CRT, IMRT, and proton plans were assessed. RESULTS: In retinoblastoma, protons resulted in the best target coverage combined with the most orbital bone sparing (10% was the mean orbital bone volume irradiated at > or =5 Gy for protons vs. 25% for 3D-CRT electrons, 69% for IMRT, 41% for a single 3D lateral beam, 51% for a 3D anterolateral beam with a lens block, and 65% for a 3D anterolateral beam without a lens block). A single appositional electron field was the next best technique followed by other planning approaches. In medulloblastoma, for posterior fossa and craniospinal irradiation, protons resulted in the least dose to the cochlea (for only posterior fossa irradiation at > or =20 Gy, 34% was the mean cochlear volume irradiated for protons, 87% for IMRT, 89% for 3D-CRT) and hypothalamus-pituitary axis (for only posterior fossa irradiation at > or =10 Gy, 21% was the mean hypothalamus-pituitary volume irradiated for protons, 81% for IMRT, 91% for 3D-CRT); additional dose reductions to the optic chiasm, eyes, vertebrae, mandible, thyroid, lung, kidneys, heart, and liver were seen. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy appeared to be the second best technique for posterior fossa irradiation. For spinal irradiation 3D-CRT electrons were better than 3D-CRT photons in sparing dose to the thyroid, heart, lung, kidney, and liver. With pelvic sarcoma, protons were superior in eliminating any dose to the ovaries (0% of mean ovarian volume was irradiated at > or =2 Gy with protons) and to some extent, the pelvic bones and vertebrae. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy did show more bladder dose reduction than the other techniques in pelvic sarcoma irradiation. CONCLUSIONS: In the diseases studied, using various techniques of 3D-CRT, electrons, IMRT, and protons, protons are most optimal in treating retinoblastomas, medulloblastomas (posterior fossa and craniospinal), and pelvic sarcomas. Protons delivered superior target dose coverage and sparing of normal structures. As dose-volume parameters are expected to correlate with acute and late toxicity, proton therapy should receive serious consideration as the preferred technique for the treatment of pediatric tumors	
0	1939	Fractionated, three-dimensional, planning-assisted proton-radiation therapy for orbital rhabdomyosarcoma: a novel technique	Biopsy, Boston, Child, Cobalt, Dose Fractionation, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Hypothalamus, Male, Massachusetts, Optic Chiasm, Orbit, Orbit/ra [Radiography], Orbital Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Orbital Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Rhabdomyosarcoma/ra [Radiography], Rhabdomyosarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Risk, Survivors, Temporal Lobe, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Treatment Outcome, Visual Acuity	PURPOSE: Most children with orbital rhabdomyosarcoma will survive their disease. However, conventional photon-radiation treatment, as part of multimodality therapy, results in varying degrees of long-term functional and cosmetic side effects. This report introduces external beam proton radiation therapy (PRT) as a conformal, three-dimensional planned radiation technique for this disease, analyzes normal tissue dosimetry, and describes the technique's application in the first 2 patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between January 1995 and February 1996, 2 patients underwent PRT following biopsy and chemotherapy for orbital rhabdomyosarcoma. Fifty and 55 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE) were delivered to the gross tumor volume and 40 CGE to clinical target volumes in both patients. A relative biologic effectiveness (RBE) of 1.1 was utilized to correlate proton dose calculations with CGE. To achieve dose conformity, a "patch technique" was utilized, where target regions were divided into segments, each treated by a separate proton field. Dose-volume histograms were obtained for target and nontarget regions, including lens, bony orbit, pituitary gland, optic chiasm, optic nerves, lacrimal gland, and ipsilateral frontal and temporal lobes. RESULTS: At 3.4 and 2.5 years after PRT, both patients are clinically and radiographically free of disease. Visual acuity remains excellent, without signs of cataract formation; pituitary function is normal; cosmetically, only mild enophthalmos is noticeable. Doses to 90%, 50%, and 5% of lens volume were kept at less than 1%, less than 2%, and less than 8%, respectively. Fifty percent of lacrimal gland volume received less than 36% of the prescribed dose and 50% of the volume of the optic chiasm, pituitary gland, and hypothalamus were restricted to less than 2%. Proton conformity to orbital contents resulted in between 9% and 36% of the prescribed dose reaching the ipsilateral temporal and frontal lobes immediately adjacent to bony orbit (5% volume). CONCLUSION: PRT can offer excellent sparing of lens and selected intraorbital and ocular normal structures, while maintaining conformal target-dose coverage. The steep dose gradient beyond the orbit minimizes irradiation of normal brain parenchyma, with almost complete sparing of the pituitary gland. Reduction of integral irradiation exposure of the periorbital region will, hopefully, reduce the risk of second malignancy later in life. Reduced radiation dose to specific organs in close proximity to, but not part of the target region promises improved functional outcome and better cosmesis for childhood cancer survivors

It is characterized by high signal on gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Radiation-induced endothelial cell damage resulting in blood-nerve barrier breakdown is hypothesized to produce this pattern, but histologic evidence of this in the optic nerve is lacking. We attempted to evaluate the effect of radiation on endothelial cells in the optic nerve. DESIGN: Case-controlled histologic study. METHODS: We studied the optic nerves of 16 enucleated eyes from patients with uveal melanoma treated with proton beam irradiation, 6 from normal eyes and 5 from eyes with unirradiated uveal melanomas. Binding of Ulex europaeus agglutinin I (UEA-I) lectin was used to identify endothelial cells in single paraffin sections. Transverse and longitudinal sections of vessels were counted in masked fashion. RESULTS: There were 49.4+/-6.9 transversely sectioned endothelial cells per millimeter of nerve in 6 optic nerves exposed to 0 to 1000 cGyE ("low-dose") compared with 17.3+/-5.3 in 10 nerves exposed to 5500 to 7000 cGyE ("high-dose") (P = 0.002). Longitudinally sectioned vessels stained with UEA-I were separately identified, with 11.5+/-2.1 in the low-dose group and 5.6+/-1.6 in the high-dose group (P = 0.044). The thickness and staining of the endothelial cell layer appeared greater in the high-dose group. Endothelial cell counts did not correlate with age, gender, acuity, or interval after irradiation. CONCLUSIONS: Increased radiation dosage to the optic nerve correlates with smaller numbers of endothelial cells	
0	716	Dosimetric impact of geometric errors due to respiratory motion prediction on dynamic multileaf collimator-based four-dimensional radiation delivery	Fluoroscopy, Humans, Lung Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Models,Theoretical, Motion, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Conformal/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Research, Respiration, Time, Time Factors	The synchronization of dynamic multileaf collimator (DMLC) response with respiratory motion is critical to ensure the accuracy of DMLC-based four dimensional (4D) radiation delivery. In practice, however, a finite time delay (response time) between the acquisition of tumor position and multileaf collimator response necessitates predictive models of respiratory tumor motion to synchronize radiation delivery. Predicting a complex process such as respiratory motion introduces geometric errors, which have been reported in several publications. However, the dosimetric effect of such errors on 4D radiation delivery has not yet been investigated. Thus, our aim in this work was to quantify the dosimetric effects of geometric error due to prediction under several different conditions. Conformal and intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plans for a lung patient were generated for anterior-posterior/posterior-anterior (AP/PA) beam arrangements at 6 and 18 MV energies to provide planned dose distributions. Respiratory motion data was obtained from 60 diaphragm-motion fluoroscopy recordings from five patients. A linear adaptive filter was employed to predict the tumor position. The geometric error of prediction was defined as the absolute difference between predicted and actual positions at each diaphragm position. Distributions of geometric error of prediction were obtained for all of the respiratory motion data. Planned dose distributions were then convolved with distributions for the geometric error of prediction to obtain convolved dose distributions. The dosimetric effect of such geometric errors was determined as a function of several variables: response time (0-0.6 s), beam energy (6/18 MV), treatment delivery (3D/4D), treatment type (conformal/IMRT), beam direction (AP/PA), and breathing training type (free breathing/audio instruction/visual feedback). Dose difference and distance-to-agreement analysis was employed to quantify results. Based on our data, the dosimetric impact of prediction (a) increased with response time, (b) was larger for 3D radiation therapy as compared with 4D radiation therapy, (c) was relatively insensitive to change in beam energy and beam direction, (d) was greater for IMRT distributions as compared with conformal distributions, (e) was smaller than the dosimetric impact of latency, and (f) was greatest for respiration motion with audio instructions, followed by visual feedback and free breathing. Geometric errors of prediction that occur during 4D radiation delivery introduce dosimetric errors that are dependent on several factors, such as response time, treatment-delivery type, and beam energy. Even for relatively small response times of 0.6 s into the future, dosimetric errors due to prediction could approach delivery errors when respiratory motion is not accounted for at all. To reduce the dosimetric impact, better predictive models and/or shorter response times are required

METHODS: Cumulative rates for each type of opacity were estimated from among the 383 patients, treated between 1987 and 1989, who had clear lenses or minimal lens changes before irradiation. Cox's proportional hazards model was used to evaluate the independent effects of tumor and treatment-related characteristics on the development of posterior subcapsular opacities in these patients. Risk factors for posterior subcapsular opacities were evaluated. RESULTS: By three years after irradiation, posterior subcapsular opacities had developed in 42% of the patients, and rates increased significantly with lens dose and with tumor height. The risk of posterior subcapsular opacities was over three times higher when the lens received a substantial dose of irradiation (adjusted relative risk, 3.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.60-6.59), as compared with minimal dose, and was three times higher when the tumor was highly elevated (adjusted relative risk, 3.05; 95% confidence interval, 1.45-6.40) as compared with minimally elevated lesions. Opacities in the other segments of the lens were age related. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that patients receiving therapeutic intraocular irradiation have a high risk of developing posterior subcapsular opacities. As expected, the leading risk determinant of posterior subcapsular change is the amount of irradiation received by the lens

METHODS: A 75-year-old Japanese man was diagnosed as having a choroidal melanoma after undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Positron emission tomography (PET) revealed a hot spot in the same location as the intraocular mass seen in MRI. Carbon ion radiotherapy was performed with a total dose of 77 Gy, and the hot spot seen by PET disappeared completely. At 15 months after carbon ion therapy, the eye had to be enucleated because of uncontrollable ocular hypertension. It was examined histologically in serial sections. RESULTS: A large tumor mass (15 x 12 mm) with high pigmentation was found in the vitreous space. Almost all tumor cells showed necrosis in every section. A small number of intact tumor cells were present at the periphery. The overlying retina did not show any necrosis, but showed mild to moderate gliosis. No intraretinal hemorrhage, lipid deposit, or protein exudate was apparent. CONCLUSIONS: Almost all tumor cells showed necrosis after radiotherapy with a carbon ion beam. However, the effect on the adjacent tissues was determined as minimal in histological analysis	
0	1627	Effects of proton and combined proton/photon beam radiation on pulmonary function in patients with resectable but medically inoperable non-small cell lung cancer	Aged, Aged,80 and over, Carbon, Carcinoma,Non-Small-Cell Lung/pa [Pathology], Carcinoma,Non-Small-Cell Lung/rt [Radiotherapy], Carcinoma,Non-Small-Cell Lung/su [Surgery], Cobalt, Combined Modality Therapy, Diffusion, Dose Fractionation, Female, Germany, Humans, Lung, Lung Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Lung Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Lung Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Male, Middle Aged, Neoadjuvant Therapy, Neoplasm Staging, Photons, Protons, Radiation, Respiratory Function Tests, Universities	STUDY OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the effects on pulmonary function of irradiating lung cancer with protons alone or protons combined with photons. DESIGN: Prospective phase I/II study. SETTING: University medical center. PATIENTS AND INTERVENTIONS: Ten patients with stage I-II non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and FEV(1) < or = 1.0 L were irradiated with protons to areas of gross disease only, using 51 cobalt gray equivalents (CGE) in 10 fractions (protocol 1). Fifteen patients with stage I-IIIA NSCLC and FEV(1) > 1.0 L received 45-Gy photon irradiation to the primary lung tumor and the mediastinum, plus a 28.8-CGE proton boost to the gross tumor volume (protocol 2). MEASUREMENTS: Pulmonary function was evaluated prior to treatment and 1 month, 3 months, and 6 to 12 months following irradiation. RESULTS: In patients receiving protocol 1, no significant changes in pulmonary function occurred. In patients receiving protocol 2, at 6 to 12 months, the diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide had declined from 61% of predicted to 45% of predicted (p < 0.05), total lung capacity had declined from 114% of predicted to 95% of predicted (p < 0.05), and residual volume had declined from 160% of predicted to 132% of predicted (p < 0.05). Airway resistance increased from 3.8 to 5.2 cm H(2)O/L/s (p < 0.05). No statistically significant changes occurred in vital capacity, FEV(1), or PaO(2). CONCLUSIONS: Our observations indicate that it is feasible to apply higher-than-conventional doses of radiation at a higher-than-conventional dose per fraction without excess pulmonary toxicity when conformal radiation techniques with protons are used

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1974 and 1995, 367 patients with chordomas (n = 195) and chondrosarcomas (n = 172) of the base of skull have been treated with combined megavoltage photon and 160 MeV proton radiotherapy. Following 3D treatment planning with delineation of target volumes and critical nontarget structures dose distributions and dose-volume histograms were calculated. Radiotherapy was given an 1.8 Gy or CGE (=Cobalt Gray Equivalent) dose per fraction, with prescribed target doses ranging from 63 CGE to 79.2 CGE (mean = 67.8 CGE). Doses to the brainstem surface were limited to < or = 64 CGE and to the brainstem center to < or = 53 CGE. RESULTS: Follow-up time ranged from 6 months to 21.4 years (mean = 42.5 months). Brainstem toxicity was observed in 17 of 367 patients attributable to treatment, resulting in death of three patients. Actuarial rates of 5 and 10-year high-grade toxicity-free survival were 94 and 88%, respectively. Increased risk of brainstem toxicity was significantly associated with maximum dose to brainstem, volume of brainstem receiving > or = 50 CGE, > or = 55 CGE, and > or = 60 CGE, number of surgical procedures, and prevalence of diabetes or high blood pressure. Multivariate analysis identified three independent factors as important prognosticators: number of surgical procedures (p < 0.001), volume of the brainstem receiving 60 CGE (p < 0.001), and prevalence of diabetes (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Tolerance of brainstem to fractionated radiotherapy appears to be a steep function of tissue volume included in high dose regions rather than the maximum dose of brainstem alone. In addition, presence of predisposing factors as well as extent of surgical manipulation can significantly lower brainstem tolerance in the individual patient

METHODS AND MATERIALS: This is a prospective study utilizing three common cranial irradiation techniques. Technique A uses a half-beam, nondivergent radiation field. Technique B has the anterior divergent field edge at the lateral bony canthus. Technique C is similar to B, but with a field collimator angle. Thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) lens dose measurements were obtained in children and phantom with all three techniques. RESULTS: Seventeen children were studied. Lens dose measurements were obtained in 14 children with technique A using MLC and blocks. In 7 of 14 children, dose measurements were obtained with MLC only. One child was treated with technique B and 2 children were treated with C, with MLC +/- blocks. In all 3 techniques, with MLC alone, the lens dose increased by 64%, 119%, and 72%, respectively. Similar results were obtained in phantom. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that independent of irradiation technique, additional custom blocking is required to maximally protect the lens with MLC shaped fields. This is due to the lack of conformity between MLC and the desired field edge at the lateral bony canthus

Treatment planning is done with the model-based treatment-planning system EYEPLAN. Tumor reconstruction is based only on a fundus composite, which often leads to an overestimation of the clinical target volume (CTV). The purpose was to exploit MRI on trial in a proton therapy-planning system by using the novel image-based treatment-planning system OCTOPUS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten patients with uveal melanomas received both a high-resolution planning CT and MRI of the eye. MR examinations were made with an eye coil. EYEPLAN requires eye geometry data for modeling, and tantalum marker clips for submillimeter positioning and additional information from ultrasound and 3-D imaging. By contrast, OCTOPUS provides the full integration of 3-D imaging (e. g., CT, MRI). CTVs were delineated in each slice. For all patients, CTVs (EYEPLAN vs. OCTOPUS) were compared intraindividually. RESULTS: OCTOPUS planning led to a mean reduction of the target volume by a factor of 1.7 (T1-weighted [T1w]) and 2.2 (T2w) without compromising safety. The corresponding field size could be scaled down on average by a factor of 1.2 (T1w) and 1.4 (T2w), respectively. CONCLUSION: Compared with the conventional EYEPLAN, MRI-based treatment planning of ocular tumors with OCTOPUS could be a powerful tool for reducing the CTV and, consequently, the treatment volume and the field size. This might be translated into a better patient compliance during treatment and a decreased late toxicity

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between November 1998 and September 2005, 54 patients with low-grade and intermediate-grade chondrosarcomas of the skull base have been treated with carbon ion radiation therapy (RT) using the raster scan technique at the Gesellschaft fur Schwerionenforschung in Darmstadt, Germany. All patients had gross residual tumors after surgery. Median total dose was 60 CGE (weekly fractionation 7 x 3.0 CGE). All patients were followed prospectively in regular intervals after treatment. Local control and overall survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Toxicity was assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria (CTCAE v.3.0) and the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG)/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) score. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 33 months (range, 3-84 months). Only 2 patients developed local recurrences. The actuarial local control rates were 96.2% and 89.8% at 3 and 4 years; overall survival was 98.2%at 5 years. Only 1 patient developed a mucositis CTCAE Grade 3; the remaining patients did not develop any acute toxicities >CTCAE Grade 2. Five patients developed minor late toxicities (RTOG/EORTC Grades 1-2), including bilateral cataract (n = 1), sensory hearing loss (n = 1), a reduction of growth hormone (n = 1), and asymptomatic radiation-induced white matter changes of the adjacent temporal lobe (n = 2). Grade 3 late toxicity occurred in 1 patient (1.9%) only. CONCLUSIONS: Carbon ion RT is an effective treatment for low- and intermediate-grade chondrosarcomas of the skull base offering high local control rates with low toxicity

Lung injury due to irradiation was evaluated by measuring routing parameters of pulmonary function. No statistically significant changes in these parameters were observed after irradiation, even in patients followed up for a period of 1 year. Chest X-ray examinations, including CT scan images, disclosed the development of nonsegmental consolidations in the irradiated areas, changing into minor fibrosis 1 year later. We concluded that heavy ion particle irradiation has minimal impact on pulmonary function, and is of therapeutic valve to elderly patients and patients with complications

Doses to the whole liver ranged from 10 to 24 Gray-equivalent (the biological equivalent of 10 to 24 Gray of low-LET photon radiation), whereas the dose to the primary lesion ranged from 53.5 to 70 Gray-equivalent (GyE). The fraction size was 2 to 3 GyE. The liver received partial as well as whole organ irradiation. Integral dose volume histograms for the liver were obtained in all 11 patients. An integral dose volume histogram displays on the ordinate the percentage of liver that was irradiated in excess of the dose specified on the abcissa. In this study, the clinical liver radiation tolerance of these patients is correlated with the information contained in an integral dose volume histogram. One patient developed radiation hepatitis. The integral dose volume histogram of this patient differed from the dose volume histograms of the other 10 patients. This difference was greatest in the range of doses between 30 and 40 GyE. Our results suggest that liver doses in excess of 30 to 35 GyE should be limited to 30% of the liver or less when 18 GyE of whole liver radiation is delivered at 2 GyE per fraction in addition to primary radiation of the pancreas or biliary system

METHODS AND MATERIALS: In 5 patients, comparative treatment planning was performed by comparing proton plans and related conventional, conformal, and IMRT photon plans. The evaluations analyzed dose-volume histogram findings of the target volumes and organs at risk (OARs, i.e., pituitary gland, optical pathway structures, brain, nontarget tissue). RESULTS: The mean and maximal doses, dose inhomogeneities, and conformity indexes for the planning target volumes were comparable for all techniques. Photon plans resulted in greater volumes of irradiated nontarget tissues at the 10-70% dose level compared with the corresponding proton plans. The volumes thereby increased by a factor of 1.3-3.1 for conventional, 1.1-3.8 for conformal, and 1.1-3.7 for IMRT. Compared with conventional techniques, conformal and IMRT photon treatment planning options similarly reduced the mean dose to the OARs. The use of protons further reduced the mean dose to the OARs by up to 65% and 62% compared with the conformal and IMRT technique, respectively. CONCLUSION: Compared with conventional treatment techniques, conformal RT and IMRT similarly enabled dose reductions to the OARs. Additional improvements were obtained using proton-based treatment planning modalities

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Volumetric cine computed tomography (CT) images were obtained on 7 lung cancer patients under free-breathing conditions with a 256-multislice CT scanner. Cardiac phase was determined by selecting systole and diastole. A WEL difference image (DeltaWEL) was calculated by subtracting the WEL image at end-systole from that at end-diastole at respiratory exhalation phase. Two calculation regions were defined: Region 1 was limited to the volume defined by planes bounding the heart; Region 2 included the entire body thickness for a given beam's-eye-view angle. RESULTS: The DeltaWEL values observed in Region 1 showed fluctuations at the periphery of the heart that varied from 20.4 (SD, 5.2) mm WEL to -15.6 (3.2) mm WEL. The areas over which these range perturbation values were observed were 36.8 (32.4) mm(2) and 6.0 (2.8) mm(2) for positive and negative WEL, respectively. The WEL fluctuations in Region 2 increased by approximately 3-4 mm WEL, whereas negative WEL fluctuations changed by approximately -4 to -5 mm WEL, compared with WEL for Region 1; areas over 20 mm WEL changes in Region 2 increased by 9 mm(2) for positive DeltaWEL and 2 mm(2) for negative DeltaWEL. CONCLUSIONS: Cine CT with a 256-multislice CT scanner captures both volumetric cardiac and respiratory motion with a temporal resolution sufficient to estimate range fluctuations by these motions. This information can be used to assess the range perturbations that charged particle beams may experience in irradiation of lung or esophageal tumors adjacent to the heart

DESIGN: Interventional case series. METHODS: In this retrospective study, 224 consecutive incident cases were treated at the Biomedical Cyclotron Centre (Nice, France) from June 1991 to December 1997. Overall, metastasis-free, local recurrence-free, and enucleation-free survival rates were calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier method using the log-rank test. The multivariate prognostic analysis was performed using the Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: The 5-year overall survival rate was 78.1% (SE: 3.7%). A largest basal tumor diameter (LTD) below 10 mm and female sex were independently associated with a better prognosis. The 5-year metastasis-free survival rate was 75.6% (SE: 3.6%). Only an LTD above 10 mm and ciliary body involvement were independently associated with metastasis. Ten patients (4.5%) had a local recurrence, which was correlated with the risk of metastasis (P =.045). The 5-year enucleation-free survival rate was 69.6% (SE: 4.0%). Once again, an LTD below 10 mm and female sex were predictive of a better prognosis. CONCLUSION: Our results with proton-beam therapy correspond to those reported in the literature. This treatment strategy is safe and yields predictably good results. In addition to the two independent prognostic factors for survival and metastasis, namely LTD and ciliary body involvement, sex also had a significant impact in our case series, but the clinical relevance of this finding is unknown

A mixture of nitrogen and oxygen containing 8.0 to 8.5% of O2 was used to provoke acute hypoxia during irradiation. The applied doses of external irradiation was simultaneously increased by 40%. On the basis of a randomized study with 120 patients, acute hypoxia was found to protect healthy tissues against post-radiation damage. When the doses of 96 Gy in the paracervical space and that of 75 Gy in the pelvic wall were applied, acute side-effects decreased significantly if compared with a conventional radiotherapeutic procedure (p less than 0.01). Radiological preconditions for using acute hypoxia in radiotherapy are discussed

Actuarial 5 (and 8) year survival rates for clinical Stage A (N = 25), B (N = 85), and C (N = 88) disease were 96% (82), 77% (63), and 61% (38). The corresponding 5 (and 8) year relapse-free survivals were 84% (67), 68% (61), and 53% (36). Actuarial rates of clinical local failure at 5 (and 8) years were 0%, (0), 12% (20), and 15% (30) for Stage A, B, and C respectively. There was a suggestion of a decrease in the force of local and overall recurrence after 8 years, although further follow-up will be necessary for confirmation. Among 42 patients who underwent pelvic lymphadenectomy followed by irradiation, lymph node status appeared to be a strong predictor of distant failure (9% (3/32) failures for node (-) patients compared to 70% (7/10) for node (+) patients). Twenty-nine patients received radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy for clinically palpable (Stage B and C) tumor. Only one of 16 patients treated post-operatively because of microscopic or gross residual disease has developed recurrence. By contrast, only 2 of 13 patients irradiated because of clinical local tumor recurrence remain alive and free of disease. We conclude that radiation therapy can provide effective long-term local control of prostate carcinoma, but that the ultimate radiocurability of the disease is not yet known

However, in general, it is totally overwhelmed by the benefit of the treatment. The same is true to a large extent for the combinations of radiation and drug therapy. After fast neutron therapy, the risk of induction of a second cancer is greater than after photon therapy. Neutron RBE increases with decreasing dose and there is a wide evidence that neutron RBE is greater for cancer induction (and for other late effects relevant in radiation protection) than for cell killing. Animal data on RBE for tumor induction are reviewed, as well as other biological effects such as life shortening, malignant cell transformation in vitro, chromosome aberrations, genetic effects. These effects can be related, directly or indirectly, to cancer induction to the extent that they express a "genomic" lesion. Almost no reliable human epidemiological data are available so far. For fission neutrons a RBE for cancer induction of about 20 relative to photons seems to be a reasonable assumption. For fast neutrons, due to the difference in energy spectrum, a RBE of 10 can be assumed. After proton beam therapy (low-LET radiation), the risk of secondary cancer induction, relative to photons, can be divided by a factor of 3, due to the reduction of integral dose (as an average). The RBE of heavy-ions for cancer induction can be assumed to be similar to fission neutrons, i.e. about 20 relative to photons. However, after heavy-ion beam therapy, the risk should be divided by 3, as after proton therapy due to the excellent physical selectivity of the irradiation. Therefore a risk 5 to 10 times higher than photons could be assumed. This range is probably a pessimistic estimate for carbon ions since most of the normal tissues, at the level of the initial plateau, are irradiated with low-LET radiation

METHODS AND MATERIALS: This study reviewed 46 patients with esophageal cancer who were treated between 1985 and 1998 using proton beams with or without X-rays. All patients had locoregionally confined disease; all but one had squamous cell carcinoma. Of the 46 patients, 40 received combinations of X-rays (median, 48 Gy) and protons (median, 31.7 Gy) as a boost. The median total dose of combined X-ray and proton radiation for the 40 patients was 76.0 Gy (range, 69.1-87.4 Gy). The remaining 6 patients received only proton beam therapy (median, 82.0 Gy; range, 75-89.5 Gy). RESULTS: The 5-year actuarial survival rate for the 46 patients, patients with T1 (n = 23), and those with T2-T4 (n = 23) was 34%, 55%, and 13%, respectively. The 5-year disease-specific survival rate for the 46 patients, those with T1, and those with T2-T4 was 67%, 95%, and 33%, respectively. The 5-year local control rate for patients with T1 and T2-T4 lesions was 83% and 29%, respectively. The site of the first relapse was locoregional for 16 patients and distant organs for 2 patients. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that proton beam therapy is an effective treatment for patients with locally confined esophageal cancer. Additional studies are required to determine the optimal total dose, fractionation schedule, and best combinations of protons and conventional X-rays with or without chemotherapy

The patients have been attended to at the Medical Radiation Institute of Tubingen between 1977 and 1982. In 95 cases sole radiation was performed as operation was impossible. The other patients underwent a combined surgical-radiotherapeutical treatment. The joint doses of radiation applied ran from 50 to 70 Gy in five to seven weeks' time. In particular we considered the total survival rate according to tumor stage, the local tumor control and the period until relapse. 22% of the primarily irradiated patients achieved complete remission, 42% reached particular remission and 15% achieved minimal tumor remission (total response rate: 79%). Merely in 8% of the cases the tumor did not respond perceptibly. In the other cases irradiation had to be interrupted because of general worsening, or the patients got lost to post-therapeutical observation. The total survival rates, all stages taken into account, arose as follows: one year: 36.8%, two years: 12.6%, five years: 7.3%. After sole radiotherapy in 67% of the cases which had a radiologically verified relapse more than six months passed by before a local recurrence tumor was stated. The bad prognosis of the esophagus carcinoma, as demonstrated in literature, is entirely confirmed-the negative selection of our patients taken into account. The high rank of radiotherapy in achieving effective palliation is emphasized

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The biologic effective dose concept is used to estimate the alpha/beta ratio and K (dose equivalent for tumor repopulation/d) for high-grade glioma patients treated in a randomized fractionation trial. The equivalent radiation dose of temozolomide (Temodar) chemotherapy was estimated from another randomized study. The method assumes that the radiotherapy biologic effective dose is proportional to the adjusted radiotherapy survival duration of high-grade glioma patients. RESULTS: The median tumor alpha/beta and K estimate is 9.32 Gy and 0.23 Gy/d, respectively. Using the published surviving fraction after 2-Gy exposure (SF2) data, and the above alpha/beta ratio, the estimated median alpha value was 0.077 Gy(-1), beta was 0.009 Gy(-2), and the cellular doubling time was 39.5 days. The median equivalent biologic effective dose of temozolomide was 11.03 Gy(9.3) (equivalent to a radiation dose of 9.1 Gy given in 2-Gy fractions). Random sampling trial simulations based on a cure threshold of 70 Gy in high-grade gliomas have shown the potential increase in tumor cure with dose escalation. Partial elimination of hypoxic cells (by chemical hypoxic cell sensitizers or carbon ion therapy) has suggested that considerable gains in tumor control, which are further supplemented by temozolomide, are achievable. CONCLUSION: The radiobiologic parameters for human high-grade gliomas can be estimated from clinical trials and could be used to inform future clinical trials, particularly combined modality treatments with newer forms of radiotherapy. Other incurable cancers should be studied using similar radiobiologic analysis

Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a mass 10 cm in diameter in the region of the middle clivus enhanced inhomogeneously by gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, and a defect in the skull base. There was evidence of compression of the anterior surface of the pons. He received proton irradiation employing a pair of parallel opposed lateral proton beams. The dose aimed at the tumor mass was 75.5 Gy, to the pharyngeal wall less than 38 Gy, and to the anterior portion of the pons less than 30 Gy. Time dose and fractionation factor was calculated at 148. Thirty-one months following treatment, he was free of clinical neurological sequelae. Proton therapy should be considered in treatment planning following initial surgical removal or for inoperable clivus chordoma

Of these patients 37 were in stage III-IV (20%). In 27 (72.9%) initial chemotherapy was administered, since 1980 combined with cisplatinum, as outlined. In 20 patients also revision of retroperitoneal nodes (54%) was made, to 19 patients adjuvant chemotherapy was administered (5th and 6th cycle). In 12 patients irradiation was indicated (32.4%). Histological examination of the preparation removed from the retroperitoneum was implemented in 15 patients: in four a vital tumour was revealed, in two a mature teratoma and in nine fibrosis or necrosis of a metastatic tumour was found. In seven patient a relapse of the disease occurred, 14 patients survive for 1-15 years. Twenty-three patients died

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Three dose plans were made for each of the six patients: one proton plan, including three beams covering the primary tumour and adjacent lymph nodes and three boost beams covering the primary tumour: one X-ray plan, eight beams including a boost with four beams and one mixed plan with four X-ray beams and a boost with three proton beams. A three dimensional treatment-planning systems, TMS, was used. The evaluation of the different plans was made by applying the biological models TCP and NTCP on the dose distributions in terms of dose-volume histograms. RESULTS: The comparison shows advantages of using protons instead of X-rays for all six patients, but in three of them, the advantage is only marginal. The dose-limiting organ at risk is the small bowel, but the proton plan and the mixed plan also spare the bladder and the femoral heads better. At 5% NTCP in any risk organ, the calculated mean TCP value for the six patients is increased by 14%-units with the proton plan and 8%-units with the mixed plan compared to X-rays only. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy has potential advantages when treating medically inoperable patients with a large rectal cancer over conventional X-ray therapy. Since the benefits are comparatively small, although clinically worthwhile, large randomised studies are needed

After treatment by heavy ion beam therapy, pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy was performed. The tumor was pT3, pN0, pM0, stage IIA. Sixteen months after the surgery, the patient was admitted to the hospital because he was vomiting blood. Hemorrhaging caused by failure of the cut end of the gastroduodenal artery into the elevated jejunum was confirmed by angiogram, and the hemorrhaging could be stopped by a transcatheter arterial embolization operation. Twenty-four months after surgery, the patient was readmitted because he was once again vomiting blood. Hemorrhaging from the elevated jejunum was suspected by hemorrhagic scintigram, but the source could not be identified on further examination, and the choice of treatment was difficult. The patient died on the 9th day after admittance to the hospital. Even on examination at autopsy, the source of the hemorrhaging could not be identified. No recurrence of cancer could be found. This has proven to be a perplexing case, in that hemorrhaging from the end of the routinely cut gastroduodenal artery occurred 16 and 24 months after heavy ion beam therapy and pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy for pancreatic cancer

One hundred and sixteen patients were treated with conventional pelvic megavoltage x-ray therapy. Sixty-four patients were treated with combined pelvic x-ray therapy plus a perineal proton beam boost to a carefully defined prostatic tumor volume. A 160 MeV proton beam has been modified to irradiate patients with localized tumors by using conventional treatment schedules. This proton beam has the physical advantage over megavoltage x-rays of reducing the dose to normal tissues adjacent to the tumor volume. By using the proton beam boost we have delivered an increased prostatic tumor dose of 500 to 700 cGy without increasing treatment morbidity at all. The two groups are actuarially analyzed for patient survival, disease-free survival and local recurrence-free survival, and thus far, no significant differences have been noted. Because of the minimal complications observed in the proton group despite a 10% increase in dose, a randomized clinical trial comparing these two treatment techniques is studied

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four hydrogen-1 MR spectroscopic imaging studies were performed in a patient with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) before, during, and after radiation therapy and at follow-up at 33 months after diagnosis of the recurrence of disease. The patient had a single, large lesion in the brain and underwent hyperfractionated radiation therapy for 4 weeks. A series of MR images was also obtained. RESULTS: The pretreatment study showed a lesion with a distinct spectral pattern: marked elevation of choline and lipids and great reduction of creatine and N-acetylaspartate. During and after treatment, H-1 MR spectroscopic images depicted a progressive reduction of the abnormal choline and lipid signals. Thirty-three months after treatment, multiple-section H-1 MR spectroscopic images showed normal spectral patterns in all sections examined. CONCLUSION: H-1 MR spectroscopy may contribute to the neuroradiologic evaluation of NHL and, in particular, may be useful in monitoring therapeutic response

Fifty-two out of 249 patients accepted for pion treatment by the end of 1986 were treated for malignant glioma with high dose pion irradiation. A substantial influence of their radioresistance was expected from increased radiation quality due to the contribution of high LET particles from pion capture, and by the possibility of target volume shaping and dose distribution related to the dynamic spot-scan conformation technique. The patients' treatment followed a dose escalation program with total doses from 2720-3420 cGy, fraction sizes from 170 to 205 cGy (90% isodose, minimum target dose), and treatment times from 4 to 5 weeks. 12/52 patients received an accelerated treatment with 3280 cGy in 14-22 days. 49/52 patients are eligible: 3 with astrocytoma of clinical aggressive behaviour, 14 with anaplastic astrocytoma (median age 42 years), and 32 patients with glioblastoma (median age 52 years). 8/49 patients had total/subtotal tumour resection, 19 patients a stereotactic biopsy. The patients were divided into three groups according to total dose, and a fourth group which received the accelerated treatment. There was no statistically significant difference in the median survival rate between the four groups, which was 13 months for the non-glioblastoma patients and 9 months for the glioblastoma patients. No radiation necrosis and no demyelination was found in 17 patients (6 recraniotomies, 11 autopsies). In 10/17 patients, clearly identifiable tumour cells were not demonstrated. NMR findings showed the tumour-surrounding oedema mostly stimulated by tumour necrosis and tumour progression. From these findings, further dose escalation programs, together with a shaping of the target volume close to the tumour, are not contraindicated

Most published clinical trials have confirmed hemoglobin to possess a significant influence on survival in patients treated with radiotherapy. In our study we have investigated the prognostic value of hemoglobin in a combined modality schedule. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-three patients with advanced head and neck tumors were treated with combined radio-chemotherapy. The therapy comprised 2 courses of induction chemotherapy with ifosfamide (1,500 mg/m2, day 1 to 5) and cisplatin (60 mg/m2, day 5) followed by hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy with a total dose of only 30 Gy. Surgery involved tumor resection and neck dissection. RESULTS: The 1-year overall survival rate and the 2-year survival rate were 79% and 56%, respectively. The 1- and 2-year recurrence-free survival rates were 68% and 49%, respectively. Prognostic factors with an impact on survival were seen in tumor size (T3 vs T4, p = 0.0088), response to radio-chemotherapy at the primary site (no vital tumor rest vs vital tumor rest, p = 0.045), response to lymph node radio-chemotherapy (no vital tumor cells vs vital tumor cells, p = 0.013) and level of hemoglobin after radio-chemotherapy (Hb > or = 11.5 g/dl vs < 11.5 g/dl, p = 0.0084). CONCLUSION: In our study hemoglobin level after radio-chemotherapy was identified for the first time to be also a significant prognostic factor (univariate analysis) in head and neck cancer patients who underwent combined radio-chemotherapy. Besides chemotherapy plus low-dose irradiation achieved similar results in comparison with radical resection and high-dose radiotherapy at least for the first 2 years after therapy. Relapsing disease could be treated with 1 additional course of radiotherapy which is supposed to be well tolerated

In the present study, we focus on posttreatment radiographic lung damage: specifically, its timing, features, and relation to dose-volume factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-three patients with 44 Stage I non-small-cell lung cancers were treated with carbon ion irradiation ranging from 59.4 to 95.4 photon Gy equivalent dose (GyE) in 18 fractions over 6 weeks, according to our dose escalation protocols. Primary lesions were irradiated by 2-4 portals. Follow-up evaluation with computed tomography (CT) was sequentially performed to assess changes in the lung. CT findings were classified into two categories: pulmonary reaction and pleural reaction. A dose-volume histogram for each patient was calculated, using a three-dimensional CT planning system. Statistical analysis was conducted using Spearman's rank test. RESULTS: The median appearance period of pulmonary reactions was 3 months after the start of carbon ion irradiation, whereas the maximum period was 6 months. The severity of pulmonary reactions statistically correlated with lung volumes irradiated no less than 20 GyE (vol. 20) and 40 GyE (vol. 40) (p = 0.017 and p = 0.0089). Geometrically unique findings in the irradiated fields were observed in 7 patients (16%). The median appearance period of pleural reactions was 4 months after the start of carbon ion irradiation. The occurrence of pleural reactions significantly correlated with planning target volume (p = 0.000098), vol. 20 (p = 0.00011), and vol. 40 (p = 0.00097). CONCLUSIONS: Lung damage after carbon ion irradiation was observed in the parenchyma and in the pleura. The severity of pulmonary reactions was correlated with dose-volume factors. These findings might provide useful information in the planning and management of carbon ion irradiation

Most patients had large melanomas; no eyes containing small melanomas developed anterior segment neovascularization. The mean onset of glaucoma was 14.1 months (range, 7-31 months). The incidence of anterior segment neovascularization increased with radiation dosage; there was an approximately three-fold increase at 80 GyE versus 60 GyE of helium ion radiation (23% vs. 8.5%) (P less than 0.05). Neovascular glaucoma occurred more commonly in larger tumors; the incidence was not affected by tumor location, presence of subretinal fluid, nor rate of tumor regression. Fifty-three percent of patients had some response with intraocular pressures of 21 mmHg or less to a combination of antiglaucoma treatments

DESIGN: A prospective phase 2 clinical trial. SETTING: Loma Linda University Medical Center. PATIENTS: Subjects with clinical stage I non-small cell lung cancer who were medically inoperable or refused surgery. INTERVENTIONS: All patients were treated with proton beam radiotherapy. The target included the gross tumor volume as seen on CT scan, with additional margin to allow for respiratory motion. A multibeam treatment plan was generated. Delivered treatment was 51 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE) in 10 fractions over 2 weeks to the initial 22 patients; the subsequent 46 patients received 60 CGE in 10 fractions over 2 weeks. RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients were analyzed for this report, with a median follow-up time of 30 months. No cases of symptomatic radiation pneumonitis or late esophageal or cardiac toxicity were seen. The 3-year local control and disease-specific survival rates were 74%, and 72%, respectively. There was significant improvement in local tumor control in T1 vs T2 tumors (87% vs 49%), with a trend toward improved survival. Cox regression analysis revealed that patients with higher performance status, female gender, and smaller tumor sizes had significantly improved survival. CONCLUSION: High-dose hypofractionated proton beam radiotherapy can be administered safely, with minimal toxicity, to patients with stage I lung cancer. Local tumor control appears to be improved when compared to historical results utilizing conventional radiotherapy, with a good expectation of disease-specific survival 3 years following treatment

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Since 1983 proton radiotherapy using 250 MeV proton beams produced by a booster synchrotron of the National Laboratory for High Energy Physics has been carried out at Proton Medical Research Center, University of Tsukuba. As of September 1990, a total of 147 patients received a partial or full treatment with proton beams with curative intent; 92 patients (63%) were treated with proton beams alone and 55 patients (37%) with combined photon and proton beams. There were 91 males and the mean age was 61.8 years old. The follow-up observation period ranged from 10 to 97 months. With regard to a total tumor dose, nearly 80% of patients received 70 Gy or more and 53% received 80 Gy or more. While dose-fractionations used depended upon tumor sites, the large majority of patients received substantially high radiation doses in terms of larger total doses (> 70 Gy) and larger fraction sizes (> 2.5 Gy) than those traditionally used. This fractionation regimen has been used because of limited availability of the accelerator or a shortage of machine time (27-30 weeks/year, 3-3.5 hr/day), and also by the expectation that the superior dose distribution possible with protons will permit administration of high radiation doses without increasing morbidities. In connection with this, we have determined the target volume by setting margins around the tumor boundary as practically small as possible, ranging from 5 to 10 mm. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The current trial has been based on a site and dose searching program, hence a wide variety of tumor sites including the aerodigestive organs has been treated. So far, our judgment is that proton therapy has proven of potential advantage in treatment of the lung, esophageal, liver, uterine cervix, prostate, and head and neck malignancies; and of possible value in treatment of high-grade gliomas, and gastric, urinary bladder, and pediatric tumors

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Since 2004, children requiring sedation can be admitted for proton therapy at Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI), Villigen, Switzerland. Children under 5 years of age with RMS of the head and the trunk were analyzed. All children were enrolled in a multidisciplinary treatment protocol and prospective, standardized evaluation of side effects was performed. RESULTS: Nine children were included aged 0.9-3.8 years (embryonal RMS in six, and alveolar, undifferentiated or nonclassified in one each). The tumor site was parameningeal (n = 4), orbital (n = 3), head and neck (n = 1), and prostate (n = 1). All children were in IRS group III. Total proton dose was 46-54 CGE (cobalt-gray equivalent). Only the myelotoxicity exceeded grade 3 or 4 (RTOG/EORTC). CONCLUSION: Proton therapy for RMS in early children is feasible and well tolerated. The prospective standardized evaluation of toxicity and quality of life needs to be continued

[Russian]	Adult, Eye, Eye Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Humans, Male, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Mortality, Physics, Protons, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods]	This paper presents the effects of proton beam therapy of 175 patients with tumors of the eye. Irradiation was performed with a narrow medical proton beam (Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Physics) with the energy of 70 MeV (Bragg's peak). The total dose was 6000-7000 rad, irradiation frequency was 5-6 sessions every other day. Irradiation was used to treat intraocular and orbital melanomas, melanomas an cancer lesions of the eyelid and conjunctiva. According to the WHO classification, tumors fell under the T2-T3N0M0 stage. The follow-up periods varied from 1 to 10 years (an average of 3.4 years). Complete tumor regression was observed in 45% of the cases, partial regression in 39%, and the absence of the effect in 16%. Twenty-two patients (12%) underwent enucleation due to progressive tumor growth (16 patients) or postradiation complications (6 patients). Hematogenous metastases within a period of 2-5 years following irradiation were noted in 4% of the cases. The results obtained indicated a high efficacy of proton beam therapy for large ocular tumors. The mortality rate from metastases following irradiation was lower than that following enucleation

METHODS: Twenty males and 6 females were submitted to external beam therapy with 4-6 MV X-rays and received 60-70 Gy in fractions of 180 cGY to 200 cGy per day, 5 days a week. Radiation therapy technique was two posterior oblique portals and a single anterior field at 100 cm SAD. After 4500 cGy portals were coned down, holding the spinal cord dose below 4500 cGy. RESULTS: Global response to therapy was 73.1%. Median survival was 11 months. The 2-year survival rate was 12.5% in patients with lesions smaller than 5 cm and 5.5% for those with lesions greater than 5 cm. Patients with grade 2 dysphagia had a median survival of 16 months, those with grade 1, 11 months and 2 patients with grade 0, 4 and 9 months. In all patients mild to moderate esophagitis was observed. Two patients developed esophagotracheal fistula. CONCLUSIONS: Exclusively radiotherapy cannot be considered the treatment of choice in III stage patients. Primary chemoradiotherapy may emerge as the treatment of choice for cancer of the esophagus

There are several methods of managing them. Validity of these methods, however, is not sufficiently studied. We therefore investigated, whether moist skin care with 3% urea lotion will reduce acute radiation skin toxicity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 88 patients with carcinomas of the head and neck undergoing radiotherapy with curative intent (mean total dose 60 Gy, range: 50-74 Gy) were evaluated weekly for acute skin reactions according to the RTOG-CTC score. In 63 patients, moist skin care with 3% urea lotion was performed. The control group consisted of 25 patients receiving conventional dry skin care. The incidence of grade I, II, and III reactions and the radiation dose at occurrence of a particular reaction were determined and statistically analyzed using the log-rank test. The dose-time relations of individual skin reactions are described. RESULTS: At some point of time during radiotherapy, all patients suffered from acute skin reactions grade I, > 90% from grade II reactions. 50% of patients receiving moist skin care experienced grade I reactions at 26 Gy as compared to 22 Gy in control patients (p = 0.03). Grade II reactions occurred at 51 Gy versus 34 Gy (p = 0.006). Further, 22% of the patients treated with moist skin care suffered from acute skin toxicity grade III as compared to 56% of the controls (p = 0.0007). CONCLUSION: Moist skin care with 3% urea lotion delays the occurrence and reduces the grade of acute skin reactions in percutaneously irradiated patients with head and neck tumors

METHODS: We treated 54 eyes of 53 patients with choroidal hemangioma. The lesions consisted of 48 circumscribed hemangiomas and six diffuse hemangiomas in patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome. The total applied dose was 27.3 Gy in four eyes, 22.7 Gy in three eyes, and 16.4 Gy to 18.2 Gy in 47 eyes. RESULTS: The retina reattached within six months after treatment in all 54 eyes and no recurrence of the secondary retinal detachment occurred within the follow-up period of 6 months to 9 years. Tumors treated with the higher doses regressed faster than tumors treated with the lower doses, but radiation-induced complications of the optic nerve appeared in all four eyes treated with a total dose of 27.3 Gy. Of 31 eyes treated with 16.4 to 18.2 Gy and followed for more than 1 year, 22 had an improvement in their visual acuity, and nine retained the same visual acuity. At the last follow-up examination, the best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 or better in nine eyes, 20/40 to 20/25 in 13 eyes, 20/100 to 20/50 in six eyes, and 20/200 or less in three eyes. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam irradiation of choroidal hemangiomas appears to be a valid therapeutic alternative. A total proton dose ranging from 16.4 to 18.2 Gy applied in four daily fractions seems adequate to ensure local control of both tumor and secondary retinal detachment

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between June 1995 and January 2000, 44 patients were treated with CIRT. Thirty patients had Stage IIIB disease, and 14 patients had Stage IVA disease. Median tumor size was 6.5 cm (range, 4.2-11.0 cm). The treatment consisted of 16 fractions of whole pelvic irradiation and 8 fractions of local boost. In the first study, the total dose ranged from 52.8 to 72.0 gray equivalents (GyE) (2.2-3.0 GyE per fraction). In the second study, the whole pelvic dose was fixed at 44.8 GyE, and an additional 24.0 or 28.0 GyE was given to the cervical tumor (total dose, 68.8 or 72.8 GyE). RESULTS: No patient developed severe acute toxicity. In contrast, 8 patients developed major late gastrointestinal complications. The doses resulting in major complications were > or =60 GyE. All patients with major complications were surgically salvaged. The 5-year local control rate for patients in the first and second studies was 45% and 79%, respectively. When treated with > or =62.4 GyE, the local control was favorable even for the patients with stage IVA disease (69%) or for those with tumors > or =6.0 cm (64%). CONCLUSIONS: In CIRT for advanced cervical cancer, the dose to the intestines should be limited to <60 GyE to avoid major complications. Although the number of patients in this study was small, the results support continued investigation to confirm therapeutic efficacy

Overall survival, local control, complications, and predictive parameters are analyzed. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fourteen patients with sacral chordomas were treated with the charged particles helium and neon between 1977 and 1989. The median dose was 7565 cGyE and the median follow up is 5 years. All patients were treated post-operatively; ten had gross residual disease. RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier survival at 5 years is 85%. Overall 5-year local control is 55%. A trend to improved local control at 5 years was seen in patients treated with neon when compared to patients treated with helium (62% vs 34%), in patients following complete resection versus patients with gross residual tumor (75% vs 40%), and in patients who had treatment courses under 73 days (61% vs 21%). Distant metastases were seen in two patients (14%). No patient developed neurologic sequelae or pain syndromes. One previously irradiated patient required colostomy, one patient had delayed wound healing following a negative post-radiation biopsy, and one patient developed a second malignancy. There were no genitourinary complications. CONCLUSION: Our experience indicates that post-operative charged particle irradiation of sacral chordomas appears to result in reasonable local control and survival with acceptable risk, and that additional evaluation on the use of heavy charged particles is warranted	
0	1105	A treatment planning comparison of intensity modulated photon and proton therapy for paraspinal sarcomas	Cobalt, Heart, Humans, Lead, Liver, Lung, Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Research, Risk, Sarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Spinal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Stomach, Switzerland	PURPOSE: A comparative treatment planning study has been undertaken between intensity modulated (IM) photon therapy and IM proton therapy (IMPT) in paraspinal sarcomas, so as to assess the potential benefits and limitations of these treatment modalities. In the case of IM proton therapy, plans were compared also for two different sizes of the pencil beam. Finally, a 10% and 20% dose escalation with IM protons was planned, and the consequential organ at risk (OAR) irradiation was evaluated. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Plans for 5 patients were computed for IM photons (7 coplanar fields) and protons (3 coplanar beams), using the KonRad inverse treatment planning system (developed at the German Cancer Research Center). IMPT planning was performed assuming 2 different sizes of the pencil beam: IMPT with a beam of full width at half-maximum of 20 mm, and IMPT with a "mini-beam" (IMPT(M), full width at half-maximum = 12 mm). Prescribed dose was 77.4 Gy or cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE) for protons to the gross tumor volume (GTV). Surface and center spinal cord dose constraint for all techniques was 64 and 53 Gy/CGE, respectively. Tumor and OAR dose-volume histograms were calculated. Results were analyzed using dose-volume histogram parameters, inhomogeneity coefficient, and conformity index. RESULTS: Gross tumor volume coverage was optimal and equally homogeneous with both IM photon and IM proton plans. Compared to the IM photon plans, the use of IM proton beam therapy leads to a substantial reduction of the OAR total integral dose in the low-level to mid-dose level. Median heart, lung, kidney, stomach, and liver mean dose and dose at the 50% volume level were consistently reduced by a factor of 1.3 to 25. Tumor dose homogeneity in IMPT(M) plans was always better than with IMPT planning (median inhomogeneity coefficient, 0.19 vs. 0.25). IMPT dose escalation (to 92.9 CGE to the GTV) was possible in all patients without exceeding the normal-tissue dose limits. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the use of IM photon therapy, when compared to IM protons, can result in similar levels of tumor conformation. IM proton therapy, however, reduces the OAR integral dose substantially, compared to IM photon radiation therapy. As a result, tumor dose escalation was always possible with IM proton planning, within the maximal OAR dose constraints. In IM proton planning, reducing the size of the proton pencil beam (using the "mini-beam") improved the dose homogeneity, but it did not have a significant effect on the dose conformity	
1	4046	Relative survival rates after alternative therapies for uveal melanoma	Adult, Aged, Boston, Cause of Death, Choroid Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Choroid Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Choroid Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Ciliary Body/re [Radiation Effects], Eye, Eye Enucleation, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Massachusetts, Melanoma, Melanoma/mo [Mortality], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Melanoma/su [Surgery], Middle Aged, Mortality, Multivariate Analysis, Proportional Hazards Models, Risk Factors, Survival, Survival Rate, Time, Time Factors, Uveal Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Uveal Neoplasms/su [Surgery]	Survival in a group of 556 patients with uveal melanoma treated by proton beam irradiation with a median follow-up of 5.3 years was compared with that of 238 patients enucleated during the same 10-year period as irradiated patients (July 1975 to December 1984) with a median follow-up of 8.8 years, and 257 patients enucleated during the preceding 10 years (January 1965 to June 1975) with a median follow-up of 17.0 years. Adjustments were made for known prognostic factors including age, tumor location, tumor height, and clinical estimate of tumor diameter (for enucleated patients this was estimated in a regression equation relating histologic to clinical measurement). The overall rate ratio for all cause mortality was 1.2 (95% confidence interval, 0.9-1.6) for the concurrent enucleation series versus proton beam, and 1.6 (95% confidence interval, 1.2-2.1) for the earlier enucleation series versus proton beam. Relative rates of metastatic death, cancer death, and all cause mortality comparing alternative treatments were found to vary with time after treatment. Interval-specific rate ratios were evaluated using proportional hazards models fitted to separate time intervals after treatment. For all three outcomes, rate ratios were over two and statistically significant for the first 2 years after treatment and closer to one and nonsignificant after year 6 comparing the two enucleation groups with proton beam. Results suggest that treatment choice has little overall influence on survival in patients with uveal melanoma	
0	6	Proton beam therapy for posterior pole circumscribed choroidal haemangioma	Adult, Choroid Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Follow-Up Studies, Hemangioma/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Protons/ae [Adverse Effects], Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation Injuries/et [Etiology]	BACKGROUND: Macular and juxtapapillary circumscribed choroidal haemangiomas (CCH) have always posed a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Proton beam therapy has been advocated by Zografos and associates as optimal for treating these tumours in this critical region as charged particles have a highly localised and uniform dose distribution. PATIENTS: We present 3 cases of CCH treated with proton beam therapy. Two patients developed radiation optic neuropathy and maculopathy, and one had a persistent exudative macular detachment following treatment. CONCLUSION: Our experience with proton therapy of these tumours has been disappointing in preventing radiation optic neuropathy and maculopathy and offers little advantage over external irradiation. The majority of our patients with this condition are now treated with low-dose lens-sparing external beam radiotherapy or brachytherapy, which has encouraging visual results and is a far more cost-effective option

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between August 1998 and December 2000, 37 patients with chordomas (n = 24) and chondrosarcomas (n = 13) were treated with carbon ion radiotherapy within a Phase I/II trial. Tumor conformal application of carbon ion beams was realized by intensity-controlled raster scanning with pulse-to-pulse energy variation. Three-dimensional treatment planning included biologic plan optimization. The median tumor dose was 60 GyE (GyE = Gy x relative biologic effectiveness). RESULTS: The mean follow-up was 13 months. The local control rate after 1 and 2 years was 96% and 90%, respectively. We observed 2 recurrences outside the gross tumor volume in patients with chordomas. Progression-free survival was 100% for chondrosarcomas and 83% for chordomas at 2 years. Partial remission after carbon ion radiotherapy was observed in 6 patients. Treatment toxicity was mild. CONCLUSION: These are the first data demonstrating the clinical feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of scanning beam delivery of ion beams in patients with skull base tumors. The preliminary results in patients with skull base chordomas and low-grade chondrosarcomas are encouraging, although the follow-up was too short to draw definite conclusions concerning outcome. In the absence of major toxicity, dose escalation might be considered

Thrombocytopenia was the most frequent complication, which resolved in all except 4 patients. Survival at 8 years was 52%, with 14% relapse-free survival. Patients with nodular histology had a more favorable prognosis than those with diffuse histology (median relapse-free survival of 24 vs. 12 months). There were 2 cases of erythroleukemia, which occurred after combination chemotherapy was given for relapse. Though TBI can offer complete remission and extended survival in advanced NHL, most patients eventually relapse and it should not be considered as a curative mode of therapy

There is no established treatment plan for the disease, which may be attributed to its rarity and aggressiveness. Surgery is the choice of treatment in early cases. Radiotherapy follows surgery, and chemotherapy has an insignificant role in its treatment. Radiation with heavy ion beams is showing promising results in cancer therapy. Compared to conventional radiation, it permits selective irradiation with minimal injury to the surrounding normal tissue, and treatment with a low dose within a short interval of time is possible. We herein report a case of PMME treated with heavy ion radiation, the first case to be reported so far, and review the relevant literature

This study evaluates modern LINAC technology for the creation of a sharp, small and functionally eloquent lesion in the thalamus. METHODS: Three patients underwent thalamotomy using a dedicated linear accelerator to radiosurgery, 2 females and 1 male, ages were 52, 53, and 73 years. Two patients presented with unilateral poststroke central pain and 1 with unilateral upper extremity pain secondary to metastatic infiltration of the brachial plexus. Maximal doses varied from 150 to 200 Gy, delivered by a 5-mm diameter collimator and 5 to 8 noncoplanar arcs evenly distributed. RESULTS: All patients gained substantial relief of their pain. They were able to reduce their medications and improve their activity levels. The patient with end-stage metastatic disease died of his malignancy 2 weeks after the treatment. One patient presented with recurrence of the pain 4 months after the treatment. No clinical complications were noticed. CONCLUSIONS: A dedicated linear accelerator is able to perform a precise and circumscribed lesion in the thalamus for pain control. Moreover, it proved to be safe, because no complications were observed. For patients using chronic anticoagulant therapy or with severe disabilities caused by cardiac, pulmonary or malignant diseases, this technique represents an alternative of treatment to radiofrequency thalamotomy

The irradiated cohort consisted of 167 patients treated at the Donner Pavilion (Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley), and the comparison cohort was the population evaluated in the Wisconsin Epidemiologic Study of Diabetic Retinopathy (WESDR). Survival analyses were performed comparing the two cohorts using three different sets of matching criteria, each more restrictive than the previous analyses. The three different strategies were (1) matched only on severity of diabetic retinopathy; (2) matched on severity of retinopathy and age; and (3) matched on severity of retinopathy, age, gender, and hypertension status. Tests of comparison were the log-rank test, the Wilcoxon test, and the likelihood ratio test. For the model matching only on severity of retinopathy, mean survival was 8.3 years for the WESDR group and 9.4 years for the ablated group (p > 0.05 for all three statistical tests). For the model matched on retinopathy and age, mean survival was 8.9 years for the WESDR group and 9.2 years for the ablated group (p=0.05 log-rank test, 0.32 Wilcoxon test, and 0.06 likelihood ratio test). For the model matching on retinopathy, age, gender, and hypertension status, mean survival was 8.9 years for the WESDR group and 11.6 years for the ablated group (p=0.72 log-rank test, 0.08 Wilcoxon test, and 0.82 likelihood ratio test). These data are compatible with the notion that pituitary ablation, and therefore induced pituitary growth hormone deficiency, may not decrease survival in those with severe diabetic retinopathy

The optimal therapeutic management is unclear but, in general, this tumour is treated with surgery followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Proton beam radiation therapy (PT) offers superior dose distributional qualities compared with X- or gamma rays, as the dose deposition occurs in a modulated narrow zone called the Bragg peak. As a result, organs at risk are optimally speared. Here, we present a patient treated with the first spinal axis segment irradiation using spot-scanning PT with a single field, combined with conventional cranio-spinal axis radiotherapy after surgery and chemotherapy, and an extensive review of the literature outlining the clinical features and treatment modality of spinal PNET.

Oncologically the combination of external radiotherapy and brachytherapy offers an alternative treatment option. The functional results and the complication rate in stage III and IV tumors of the oral tongue, floor of mouth and oropharynx are described in a patients series. METHOD: The follow-up includes 17 consecutive patients who were primarily treated by a combination of external radiotherapy and brachytherapy between 1997 and 2000. The oncological benefit (complete remission, disease-free survival), the functional results (mastication, swallowing, speech and pain) and the complications were reviewed. RESULTS: After the follow-up period 16/17 patients were alive. There were 3 major complications, one of them lethal. The functional results resembled those after surgical resections. CONCLUSIONS: A combined radiotherapy is a feasible method of treating patients who refrain from surgery. Moreover the application ranges from inoperability to postoperative radiotherapy in cases with close or positive margins. In connection with neck-dissections and therapy of recurrent cancer major complications may occur. In contrast to the general opinion radiation therapy was not superior to surgical resection concerning functional sequelae

METHOD: Since 1991, four consecutive patients from our institution with this tumour have been referred for postoperative proton beam radiotherapy. RESULT: We have experienced an unusually high complication rate (50%) of delayed radiation optic neuropathy. This has resulted in profound, bilateral visual loss at 1 and 2 years postproton beam treatment. CONCLUSION: It has served as a reminder that proton beam therapy is not an innocuous treatment option and this devastating complication should be taken into account when discussing the management of clivus chordoma. We postulate whether the optic apparatus is particularly sensitive to proton vs photon damage

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirteen patients with skull base chordoma who were treated with proton beams with or without X-rays at the University of Tsukuba between 1989 and 2000 were retrospectively reviewed. A median total tumor dose of 72.0 Gy (range, 63.0-95.0 Gy) was delivered. The patients were followed for a median period of 69.3 months (range, 14.6-123.4 months). RESULTS: The 5-year local control rate was 46.0%. Cause-specific, overall, and disease-free survival rates at 5 years were 72.2%, 66.7%, and 42.2%, respectively. The local control rate was higher, without statistical significance, for those with preoperative tumors <30 mL. Partial or subtotal tumor removal did not yield better local control rates than for patients who underwent biopsy only as the latest surgery. CONCLUSION: Proton beam therapy is effective for patients with skull base chordoma, especially for those with small tumors. For a patient with a tumor of <30 mL with no prior treatment, biopsy without tumor removal seems to be appropriate before proton beam therapy. [References: 38]

This proton beam has the physical advantage of megavoltage x-rays of reducing the radiation dose to normal tissues adjacent to the tumor volume. A perineal proton technique used as boost therapy (2,000 to 2,500 rads) was evaluated in the definitive irradiation of 17 patients with localized prostatic carcinoma. This technique allows repeated daily treatment of the carefully defined target volume with a precision of +/- 2 mm. Total dose to the prostatic tumor, but not to the posterior rectum, has been increased by 500 to 700 rads. After 12 to 27 months of observation, no noteworthy rectal reaction has developed in a patient, easily managed urethral strictures have developed in two patients, and all but one are locally controlled

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the hypothesis that increasing the radiation dose delivered to men with clinically localized prostate cancer improves disease outcome. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Randomized controlled trial of 393 patients with stage T1b through T2b prostate cancer and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels less than 15 ng/mL randomized between January 1996 and December 1999 and treated at 2 US academic institutions. Median age was 67 years and median PSA level was 6.3 ng/mL. Median follow-up was 5.5 (range, 1.2-8.2) years. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomized to receive external beam radiation to a total dose of either 70.2 Gy (conventional dose) or 79.2 Gy (high dose). This was delivered using a combination of conformal photon and proton beams. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Increasing PSA level (ie, biochemical failure) 5 years after treatment. RESULTS: The proportions of men free from biochemical failure at 5 years were 61.4% (95% confidence interval, 54.6%-68.3%) for conventional-dose and 80.4% (95% confidence interval, 74.7%-86.1%) for high-dose therapy (P<.001), a 49% reduction in the risk of failure. The advantage to high-dose therapy was observed in both the low-risk and the higher-risk subgroups (risk reduction, 51% [P<.001] and 44% [P = .03], respectively). There has been no significant difference in overall survival rates between the treatment groups. Only 1% of patients receiving conventional-dose and 2% receiving high-dose radiation experienced acute urinary or rectal morbidity of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) grade 3 or greater. So far, only 2% and 1%, respectively, have experienced late morbidity of RTOG grade 3 or greater. CONCLUSIONS: Men with clinically localized prostate cancer have a lower risk of biochemical failure if they receive high-dose rather than conventional-dose conformal radiation. This advantage was achieved without any associated increase in RTOG grade 3 acute or late urinary or rectal morbidity

Gross total resection with negative margins is rarely achieved, and the risks of functional, structural, and cosmetic deficits limit the radiation dose using conventional radiation techniques. Twenty-nine children and adolescents treated with conformal proton radiotherapy (proton RT) were analyzed to assess treatment efficacy and safety. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between July 1992 and April 1999, 29 patients with mesenchymal tumors underwent fractionated proton (13 patients) or fractionated combined proton and photon (16 patients) irradiation. The age at treatment ranged from 1 to 19 years (median 12); 14 patients were male and 15 female. Tumors were grouped as malignant or benign. Twenty patients had malignant histologic findings, including chordoma (n = 10), chondrosarcoma (n = 3), rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 4), and other sarcomas (n = 3). Target doses ranged between 50.4 and 78.6 Gy/cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE), delivered at doses of 1.8-2.0 Gy/CGE per fraction. The benign histologic findings included giant cell tumors (n = 6), angiofibromas (n = 2), and chondroblastoma (n = 1). RT doses for this group ranged from 45.0 to 71.8 Gy/CGE. Despite maximal surgical resection, 28 (97%) of 29 patients had gross disease at the time of proton RT. Follow-up after proton RT ranged from 13 to 92 months (mean 40). RESULTS: Of the 20 patients with malignant tumors, 5 (25%) had local failure; 1 patient had failure in the surgical access route and 3 patients developed distant metastases. Seven patients had died of progressive disease at the time of analysis. Local tumor control was maintained in 6 (60%) of 10 patients with chordoma, 3 (100%) of 3 with chondrosarcoma, 4 (100%) of 4 with rhabdomyosarcoma, and 2 (66%) of 3 with other sarcomas. The actuarial 5-year local control and overall survival rate was 72% and 56%, respectively, and the overall survival of the males was significantly superior to that of the female patients (p = 0.002). Of the patients with benign tumors, 1 patient (giant cell tumor) had local failure at 10 months. The other 8 patients continued to have local tumor control; all 9 patients were alive at last follow-up (actuarial 5-year local control and overall survival rate of 89% and 100%, respectively). Severe late effects (motor weakness and sensory deficits) were observed in 2 (7%) of 29 patients. CONCLUSION: Proton RT for children with aggressively recurring tumors after major skull base surgery can offer a considerable prospect of tumor control and survival. Longer follow-up is necessary to assess the real value of protons, in particular with regard to bone growth and cosmetic outcome

Lung fibrosis was observed in 5.5% of cases 15 months after fast electron treatment, as opposed to 14.1% after TCT. The mean age of patients with such complications after fast-electron treatment was much higher than after TCT (70.16 yr as opposed to 55.55 yr)

The median follow-up is 17 months. In 51 patients (48.5%) initial PSA levels exceeded the maximum normal value of 20 ng/ml. Nine patients kept non-declining high levels just after radiotherapy. Only one of these is free of disease. Assuming PSA levels decrease exponentially during radiotherapy, a mean half-life of 62 days (median 54, SD 26 days) was calculated. Three out of five patients with a PSA half-life of more than 88 days relapsed as compared to a 8% (3/37) relapse rate in patients with a "normal" half-life. Prolonged PSA half-life suggests residual disease. PSA levels are expected to further decrease after radiation. Six months after irradiation persistent high PSA levels were found in 14/51 (27.5%) patients. Only four of them had no evidence of manifest disease. Important negative prognostic factors for disease control in our series were non-declining high levels of PSA, a PSA serum half-life exceeding 88 days and persistence of elevated PSA values longer than six months after treatment. In our opinion, PSA is a valuable marker in the follow-up of prostate cancer patients during and after radiotherapy

Optimal radiation dose appeared to be 30-40 Gy. Surgery should be performed not later than three weeks after termination of radiation treatment. Preoperative irradiation may be followed by pulmonary complications. Due to application of combined treatment of esophageal cancer, percentage of operable cases is increased. However, no effect on 5-year survival was registered	
0	465	Influence of the linac design on intensity-modulated radiotherapy of head-and-neck plans	Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Equipment Design, Head and Neck Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Netherlands, Oropharyngeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Parotid Gland/re [Radiation Effects], Particle Accelerators, Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Intensity-Modulated/mt [Methods], Research, Tomography,X-Ray Computed	In this study, we quantify the impact of linac/MLC design parameters on IMRT treatment plans. The investigated parameters were leaf width in the MLC, leaf transmission, related to the thickness of the leaves, and penumbra related primarily to the source size. Seven head-and-neck patients with stage T1-T3N0-N2cM0 oropharyngeal cancer were studied. For each patient nine plans were made with a different set of linac/MLC parameters. The plans were optimized in Pinnacle(3) v7.6c and PLATO RTS v2.6.4, ITP v1.1.8. A hypothetical ideal linac/MLC was introduced to investigate the influence of one parameter at a time without interaction of other parameters. When any of the three parameters was increased from the ideal set-up values (leaf width 2.5 mm, transmission 0%, penumbra 3 mm), the mean dose to the parotid glands increased, given the same tumour coverage. The largest increase was found for increasing leaf transmission. The investigation showed that by changing more than one parameter of the ideal linac/MLC set-up, the increase in the mean dose was smaller than the sum of dose increments for each parameter separately. As a reference to clinical practice, we also optimized the plans of the seven patients with the clinically used Elekta SLi 15, equipped with a standard MLC with a leaf width of 10 mm. As compared to the ideal linac, this resulted in an increase of the average dose to the parotid glands of 5.8 Gy

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of all patients between 1990 and 2005 with the diagnosis of bladder and prostate cancer was performed. Of 125 total patients new onset urothelial carcinoma developed in 11 after undergoing external beam radiation therapy for prostate cancer. RESULTS: Whole pelvis external beam radiation therapy with a proton boost to the prostate was the radiation modality in 7 of the 11 patients (64%), while the remaining 4 patients received standard external beam radiation only. Urothelial carcinoma was detected a mean of 3.07 years after completion of radiation therapy in the proton group, compared to a mean latency period of 5.75 years in the standard radiation group (p = 0.09). Average patient age at diagnosis was 72 years (range 64 to 84). All patients presented with gross hematuria and had cystoscopic findings of coexisting radiation cystitis. Of the 11 patients 5 (45%) presented with grade 3 carcinoma and eventually 7 (64%) required radical cystectomy. Urothelial tumors with sarcomatoid features (carcinosarcoma and spindle cell sarcomatoid) developed in 2 patients (18%). Of the 11 patients 10 (91%) were nonsmokers at the time of urothelial carcinoma diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Urothelial carcinoma in patients with previous radiation therapy for prostate cancer is often high grade, and the majority of patients have cancer progression requiring cystectomy. A high incidence of urothelial carcinoma with sarcomatoid features was seen in these patients

The proposed fractionation strategy consisted of a SIB treatment following a first phase of conventional fractionation to the elective volume (named SEQ/SIB). The novel method was compared to a conventional sequential fractionation and to a full SIB approach. Treatment plans were designed for five patients on the proton planning system developed for spot scanning at the Paul Scherrer Institute of Villigen (CH). Three to five beams were applied for all plans and fractionations. All effective dose distributions were corrected using biological models to take into account repopulation and time at repopulation onset. Corrected and uncorrected plans were compared on the basis of dosimetry criteria and dose-volume histograms. The results showed a dosimetric advantage for the SEQ/SIB approach in terms of target coverage, without significant disadvantages for risk structures and healthy tissue. Considering the high logistic impact and the limited availability of radiation facilities, the clinical exploitation of accelerated SIB treatment with protons appears promising

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A study was performed on a group of 18 patients with cancer of the head and neck, lung, and pelvis who were treated with irregularly shaped fields. The BEV dosimetry of the fields shaped with cerrobend blocks and the MLC was measured with films at the depth of dose prescription in a solid water phantom. A "one-half-leaf" insertion convention was used to shape the MLC. In addition, an average of 15 sequential daily port films was taken per patient during the course of radiotherapy. The port films were aligned with the prescription film for each patient. Systematic error and random error of treatment setup for each patient were calculated. The effects of setup variation were incorporated by convolving the patient portal imaging data with the corresponding BEV film dosimetry. Two parameters were used to quantify the BEV dosimetry. First, the field penumbra width was calculated, which represented the average of the normal separations between 20 and 80% isodose lines along the prescription outline. Second, the ratio of areas covered by the 90 and 20% isodose lines, A90/20, was determined. The BEV dosimetry was then characterized with and without the effects of treatment setup variation. In addition, the difference in BEV dosimetry between the cerrobend block and the MLC was used to estimate the corresponding changes in tumor control probability (TCP). These changes were also compared to the changes in TCP for the treatment with or without the effects of random setup variation. RESULTS: With or without daily setup variation, the use of cerrobend block was more favorable than the MLC in terms of the field penumbra width and A90/20 for all treatment sites. In the absence of daily variation, the MLC field penumbra width was on average 1.3 mm larger than that of the cerrobend block, and 0.9 mm larger in the presence of daily setup variation. Similarly, the ratio A90/20 of the cerrobend block was on average 0.03 larger than that of MLC without daily setup variation, and 0.02 with daily setup variation. The difference in field penumbra width and A90/20 between the MLC and the cerrobend block was slightly reduced due to the effects of daily setup variation. For both the cerrobend block and the MLC, daily setup variation produced a significant increase in the field penumbra width, 2.3 mm for the cerrobend block and 1.9 mm for the MLC, and a decrease in the A90/20, 0.06 for the former and 0.05 for the latter. The change due to the daily setup variation was about a factor of 2 larger than the changes due to replacing the cerrobend block with the MLC. Using the TCP model, the change in TCP due to the daily setup variation was more than a factor of 3 larger than the change in TCP due to replacing the cerrobend block with the MLC. It was noted that the average changes in the penumbra, the A90/20 and the TCP calculated for the patient population did not adequately describe the changes for the individual patient. CONCLUSION: Our results do not show significant dosimetric differences between the MLC and the cerrobend block in conventional radiation treatment, whether or not daily setup variation was taken into consideration. The effects of daily setup variation alone produced a larger dosimetric change. The same results were obtained when the data were applied to calculate changes in TCP. For optimal radiation therapy, efforts should be concentrated on reducing daily setup variation. Our results also demonstrate the importance of frequent evaluation of MLC treatment using electronic portal imaging devices

This is a preliminary assessment of treatment-related morbidity and tumor response. Sixteen patients with T1-T2b prostate cancer underwent proton beam therapy. Acute and late toxicity was scored according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria Grading System (version 2.0, April 1999) and to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group grading system, respectively. Local control was assessed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values. Although skin toxicity and bladder irritability were commonly observed, none of the patients developed grade III or IV toxicity. Of 9 patients in whom the primary lesion was detected by MRI, partial response and no change (NC) was observed in 6 (66.7%) and 3 (33.3%) patients, respectively. Four patients presented normal PSA value before treatment due to the previous endocrine therapy. However, the other 12 patients with elevated PSA value before treatment showed complete response. No patients showed PSA failure within the median follow-up period of 11.9 months. Although longer follow-up is necessary, minimum toxicity and good short-term clinical responses were observed following proton beam therapy in T1-T2 prostate cancer patients

This study analyzes relapse and survival in a community-based population with L-SCLC according to age and comorbidity. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed on 174 patients with L-SCLC referred to the British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver Island Centre, between January 1991 and December 1999. Patient and treatment characteristics, disease response, relapse, and survival were compared among three age cohorts: <65 years (n = 55, 32%), 65-74 years (n = 76, 44%), and > or =75 years (n = 43, 25%); and according to Charlson comorbidity scores 0, 1, and > or =2. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify independent prognostic factors associated with treatment response and survival. RESULTS: Patient factors that significantly differed with age were functional status classified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status and number of comorbidities. Increasing age was significantly associated with fewer diagnostic scans. Combined modality chemoradiotherapy (CRT) was given in 86%, 66%, and 40% of patients ages <65, 65-74, and > or =75 years, respectively, (p <0.0001). Thoracic irradiation use was comparable among the age cohorts (p >0.05), but chemotherapy use varied significantly with less intensive regimens, fewer cycles, and lower total doses with advancing age (p <0.05). Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) was used in 41 patients, only 3 of whom were age >70 years. Overall response rates to primary treatment significantly decreased with advancing age: 91%, 79%, and 74% in patients ages <65, 65-74, and > or =75 years, respectively (p = 0.014). Treatment toxicity and relapse patterns were similar across the age cohorts. Overall 2-year survival rates were significantly lower with advancing age: 37%, 22%, and 19% (p = 0.003), with corresponding median survivals of 17, 12, and 7 months among patients ages <65, 65-74, and > or =75 years, respectively. On multivariate analysis, age and Charlson comorbidity scores were not significantly associated with treatment response and survival. Independent prognostic factors favorably associated with survival were good performance status, normal lactate dehydrogenase, absence of pleural effusion, and > or =four cycles of chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: Increasing age was associated with decreased performance status and increased comorbidity. Older patients with L-SCLC were less likely to be treated with CRT, intensive chemotherapy, and PCI. Treatment response and survival rates were lower with advancing age, but this may be attributed to poor performance status and suboptimal treatment rather than age. [References: 31]

Patient's topometric preparation and method of transperineal irradiation were described. A method of radiotherapy with proton beam boost was applied to 17 patients with different clinical stages of disease. After 6-20 months of the follow-up all the patients have been alive without clinical signs of tumor. In most of the patients radiation reactions of the critical organs were regarded as mild ones. Chronic and long-term radiation injuries were not detected in the patients who lived over 1 year

The development of optimized treatment plans for X-rays and protons followed by a comparative evaluation is one method of selecting tumor sites best suited for proton treatment. The preliminary results of comparative treatment planning for base of skull tumors and carcinoma of the prostate are discussed. These comparisons suggest a clinical gain for proton treatment of tumors in these locations. The clinical experience with fractionated proton treatment of several tumor sites is also discussed. The results of high dose proton treatment of chordomas and low grade chondrosarcomas of the base of skull is particularly promising: an actuarial 5-year local control of 78% has been obtained in 50 patients followed for a minimum of 22 months

After a 2 to 4 year follow-up, primary cancer was found to be controlled in 59 patients, a recurrence was noted in 16 patients but 12 patients had died without precise information concerning recurrence. We examined the correlation between recurrence and seven prognostic factors. Among these factors, the tumor volume, age, and the red blood corpuscle sedimentation rate showed a relatively strong correlation. A multivariable analysis (quantification methods II) was undertaken in order to integrate these prognostic factors and the score that was calculated from this analysis showed a strong correlation to local control. We believe that this score can be used for predicting recurrences and can be applied to the selection of patients for new treatments like hyperthermia or high LET irradiation

In this paper, the present status of BNCT for malignant melanoma was introduced. As a melanoma-targetting 10B-compound, 10B-paraboronophylalanine (BPA) was used. It was administered by multiple subcutaneous injection or intravenous drip infusion. We adopted the maximum tolerance dose to the skin as a therapeutic dose regardless of the tumor 10B concentration, because we cannot directly measure it. For this purpose, an approximation of skin concentration was made using blood data just after the administration. We treated 14 melanoma patients in this way and obtained good local control of the tumor with tolerable skin reaction. More experience with logical analysis and basic research is necessary for further development of this therapy

T2 may be significantly prolonged within 2 h after ingestion of glucose and fructose due to changed water distribution in the melanoma. This method is used to follow melanomas for up to 6 years after proton beam irradiation. In the tumours, T2 was shortened in parallel in all the lesions during the first 9 months. After this, T2 increased only in tumours which showed recurrence. T2 determination and histopathological examination revealed no signs of recurrence in eyes which were enucleated due to neovascular glaucoma. It is concluded that MR imaging performed with carbohydrate loading, registers metabolic changes induced in the tumour, giving this method great validity in the follow-up of choroidal malignant melanoma after irradiation. Eighteen patients treated with proton beam for uveal melanoma at the cyclotron in Uppsala, Sweden, were followed

Immediate and late tolerances were excellent in all cases (follow-up 2 to 50 months). Two patients recurred locally (marginal failures), seven are alive and doing well. At Loma Linda, 28 children were treated between 1991 and 1994, 16 for a benign tumor of the brain and twelve for a malignant one. With a follow-up of seven to 49 months, three patients died (grade 2 to 4 gliomas), one is living with a persistent disease. Four children had treatment-related toxicity (one cataract, two hormonal failures and two seizures). The other children are doing well. At MGH Boston, 18 children with skull base-cervical spine chordomas have been reported. At five years, actuarial survival and disease-free survival have been 68 and 63%, respectively. Children with cervical sites had a worse prognosis (p = 0.008). Four children had radiation-related morbidity: two pituitary failures, one temporal lobe necrosis, one temporal muscle fibrosis.

A 20-year-old patient with NF2 presenting deafness due to bilateral acoustic neurinomas and unilateral amaurosis due to a meningioma of the optic nerve developed a pigmented parapapillary choroidal tumor. Despite signs indicating the diagnosis of a melanoma, periodic observation was chosen in order to postpone functional amputation following optic nerve irradiation. The tumor growth was slow during the 5 years that followed, and once progression became rapid, the tumor was treated by accelerated proton beam radiotherapy. One year later, visual acuity diminished due to actinic optic neuropathy and was stabilized at 0.3 for the 2 following years. The tumor presented objective signs of regression, and no sign of metastatic disease was observed. The therapeutic approach in this case provided local control of the tumor while preserving useful visual function

Clinical and radiological (MRI) follow-up series suggest that having hemorrhaged once, recurrent hemorrhage with progressive neurologic dysfunction may commonly occur. We have therefore chosen to treat these lesions when first symptomatic with stereotactic linear radiosurgery (SLR). We now report, after a median follow-up of 27 months, 12 patients with CAs (9 women, 3 men, mean age 40 years) treated in this fashion. Ten patients presented with hemorrhage (3 had more than one hemorrhage): two patients had new onset seizures. All patients had enhanced MRI/MRAs characteristic of CA. There were five brainstem and five thalamic CAs, and one each in the temporal lobe and insula. Cerebral angiograms were done in 8 patients for comparison with their respective MRAs. Only one CA was visualized in the late venous phase on cerebral angiogram and identical vascular features were appreciated on the MRA. The diameter of the CAs ranged from 1.0 to 3.0 cm with a mean of 1.6 cm. Dosimetry planning was based on MRI/CT features and the mean dose at the isocenter was 2.167 cGy (range = 2,000-2,500 cGy) delivered with a mean collimation diameter of 1.46 cm (range = 1.0-2.0 cm). All 12 patients continued to improve neurologically after SLR and had MRI-documented changes in their lesions: in general, the lesions became smaller and signal characteristics converted to methemaglobin. However, 1 patient had an early post-SLR hemorrhage, documented by MRI, at 4.5 months.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

METHODS: Between May 1998 and April 2004, 11 patients (four were recurrences because they previously had been treated with surgery and/or radiotherapy) underwent transnasal transsphenoidal endoscopic surgery for cranial base chordomas and chondrosarcomas at the Neurosurgical Department of Bellaria Hospital in Bologna. The transsphenoidal endoscopic approach and the ethmoid-pterygo-sphenoidal endoscopic approach were used to accomplish resection of the lesions involving the clivus and extending up to the parasellar region and to the petrous apex, or within the cavernous sinus. RESULTS: Patient follow-up periods ranged from 15 to 69 months (mean, 27 mo). Three patients died of chordoma progression at 20, 14, and 10 months, respectively, after endoscopic treatment. One patient experienced two recurrences; the first was treated using a new endoscopic approach, whereas the second, 1 year later, was treated by means of a far lateral approach. Four patients underwent postoperative proton beam radiotherapy, whereas one underwent a conventional megavoltage x-radiation therapy. However, postoperative radiotherapy was not administered in the two patients treated for cranial base chondrosarcoma. CONCLUSION: The flexibility of this new technique with respect to the classical microscopic transsphenoidal approach permits us to widen the horizon of surgical management of aggressive cranial base tumors such as clival chordomas and chondrosarcomas

DESIGN AND SETTING: Nonrandomized prospective study of a case series in a tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: Nine consecutive patients with newly diagnosed esthesioneuroblastoma or neuroendocrine carcinoma of the paranasal sinuses from June 1992 to October 1995 underwent this treatment protocol. INTERVENTIONS: After histological diagnosis and detailed imaging, 2 cycles of cisplatin and etoposide chemotherapy were instituted. Chemotherapy responders were treated with combined photon and stereotaxic fractionated proton radiation therapy totaling approximately 68 Gy to the primary site, whereas poor responders were treated with surgical resection followed by postoperative radiation. In both cases, therapy was then concluded with 2 additional cycles of cisplatin and etoposide chemotherapy. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Response to therapy, survival, disease-free survival, and complications of therapy were examined. RESULTS: Nine patients with a median Dulguerov T stage of T3 (range, T2 to T4) completed the treatment protocol, with mean follow-up after diagnosis of 20.5 months. Eight of 9 patients exhibited a dramatic response to therapy with remission of their tumor, and resection was not required. One patient failed to respond to induction chemotherapy and received surgical therapy to be followed by postoperative radiotherapy. There have been no recurrences (mean disease-free interval of 14.0 months). Complications were limited and generally transient. CONCLUSIONS: The use of combined cisplatin and etoposide chemotherapy with proton radiation has demonstrated initial success in treatment of these tumors. Dramatic response from chemotherapy is possible even in bulky or unresectable disease. This protocol has an acceptable complication rate and conveys less morbidity than craniofacial resection and conventional radiotherapy. Further follow-up will be required to determine the long-term success rate of this therapeutic protocol

METHODS AND MATERIALS: We followed 11 patients receiving an exclusive external radiation therapy for brain tumor for 8 months. They underwent proton MRS scans before any radiation exposure and 1, 4, and 8 months after they began the radiation therapy. The patients received 60 Gy in tumoral area fractionated over 6 weeks. The contralateral normal brain hemisphere received a radiation dose from 20 to 50 Gy. The main metabolite concentrations (N-acetylaspartate (NAA), choline compounds (Cho), creatine (Cr), and lactate (Lac) were evaluated by the areas of the peaks after peak fitting. Normalized values (NV) were obtained by processing the ratio of the peak area of a given metabolite to the sum of all the spectrum peak areas; ratios (NAA/Cho, NAA/Cr, and Cho/Cr) were processed. One patient, who received panencephalic radiotherapy (30 Gy) after metastasectomy from a primary kidney adenocarcinoma, has been monitored with 1H-MRS eight times for 6 months to observe the onset of the metabolic changes. RESULTS: Changes were observed in irradiated normal brain tissue 4 months after radiation therapy began: the NAA/Cho and NAA/Cr ratios and the NAA (NV) decreased while the Choline (NV) increased. Four months later, normal values were recovered. CONCLUSION: 1H-MRS has the potentiality to detect and to evaluate in vivo early adverse metabolic effects of radiation therapy in the normal human brain. These changes are significant 4 months after the radiation therapy began and appear to resolve over time

In the majority of cases, it occurs against a background of hepatitis B or C viral infection and/or liver cirrhosis, and is associated with a dismal prognosis of a few months. Current treatments in routine clinical practice are surgical resection and liver transplantation, but these therapies are applicable to only a small proportion of patients and prolongation of survival is restricted. Other treatment options include intra-arterial chemotherapy, transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation, percutaneous ethanol injection, cryotherapy, thermotherapy, proton therapy, or a wide range of their possible combinations. The current lack of definitive data, however, limits the use of these therapies. Another option is gene therapy, which although in its infancy at the present time, may have a significant role to play in the future management of hepatocellular carcinoma. [References: 108]	
1	4141	Stereotactic heavy-charged-particle Bragg-peak radiation for intracranial arteriovenous malformations.[see comment]	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Cerebral Angiography, Cerebral Hemorrhage/et [Etiology], Child, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Helium, Helium/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/ra [Radiography], Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/rt [Radiotherapy], Male, Methods, Middle Aged, Photons, Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy/ae [Adverse Effects], Research, Risk, Universities	BACKGROUND. Heavy-charged-particle radiation has several advantages over protons and photons for the treatment of intracranial lesions; it has an improved physical distribution of the dose deep in tissue, a small angle of lateral scattering, and a sharp distal falloff of the dose. METHODS. We present detailed clinical and radiologic follow-up in 86 patients with symptomatic but surgically inaccessible cerebral arteriovenous malformations that were treated with stereotactic helium-ion Bragg-peak radiation. The doses ranged from 8.8 to 34.6 Gy delivered to volumes of tissue of 0.3 to 70 cm3. RESULTS. Two years after radiation treatment, the rate of complete obliteration of the lesions, as detected angiographically, was 94 percent for lesions smaller than 4 cm3, 75 percent for those of 4 to 25 cm3, and 39 percent for those larger than 25 cm3. After three years, the rates of obliteration were 100, 95, and 70 percent, respectively. Major neurologic complications occurred in 10 patients (12 percent), of whom 8 had permanent deficits. All these complications occurred in the initial stage of the protocol, before the maximal dose of radiation was reduced to 19.2 Gy. In addition, hemorrhage occurred in 10 patients from residual malformations between 4 and 34 months after treatment. Seizures and headaches were less severe in 63 percent of the 35 and 68 percent of the 40 patients, respectively, who had them initially. CONCLUSIONS. Given the natural history of these inaccessible lesions and the high risks of surgery, we conclude that heavy-charged-particle radiation is an effective therapy for symptomatic, surgically inaccessible intracranial arteriovenous malformations. The current procedure has two disadvantages: a prolonged latency period before complete obliteration of the vascular lesion and a small risk of serious neurologic complications

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified 13 STS patients treated with PT between July 1998 and May 2005 in our institutional database. Tumor histology varied with the most common histologic subtypes including liposarcoma and peripheral nerve sheet tumor. All tumors were located in vicinity of critical structures, such as the spinal cord, optic apparatus, bowel, kidney, or bowel. Of the patients, 6 and 5 patients received PT either as adjuvant therapy for non-R0 resection or for recurrence, respectively. Two patients received radical PT for unresectable disease. The median prescribed dose was 69.4 CGE (CGE = proton Gy x 1.1)-Gy (range, 50.4-76.0) at 1.8 to 2 CGE-Gy (median, 1.9) per fraction. Pre-PT anthracycline-based chemotherapy was delivered to 3 patients only. No patient has been lost to follow-up (median 48.1 months, range, 19.1-100.7 months). RESULTS: Of the 13 patients, all but 2 patients were alive. Local recurrence developed in 3 (23%) patients. The administered dose to these patients was < or =60 Gy-CGE. Distant control was achieved in all but 2 patients (lung metastasis), 1 of whom presented with a concomitant local recurrence. The 4-year local control and metastasis-free survival rates were 74.1% and 84.6%, respectively. Late grade > or =2 toxicity was observed in only 2 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Spot scanning PT is an effective and safe treatment for patient with STS in critical locations. The observed toxicity rate was acceptable

Eight patients received three weekly fractions of 0.7 to 1.33 Gy and two patients four weekly fractions of 0.8 Gy to total doses of 7.4 to 10.4 Gy. Two complete and six partial remissions of ataxia and motor disturbances were observed. Bladder dysfunctions in five patients cleared up partially in three cases. In two patients the symptomatology remained unchanged. After a follow-up of eight to 88 months two initially complete and two out of six partial remission were maintained. No severe late effects of the skin have been determined. In summary it is concluded that for incompletely resected "pencil"-gliomas fast neutron therapy seems to be a feasible treatment modality

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Two children, one with a parameningeal rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) and a second with a medulloblastoma, were used as models for the purpose of this study. After defining the target and critical structures, treatment plans were calculated and optimized, four for the RMS case (conventional X-ray, IM X-rays, protons, and IM protons) and three for the irradiation of the spinal axis in medulloblastoma (conventional X-ray, IM X-rays, protons). Secondary cancer incidence was estimated using a model based on Publication No. 60 of the International Commission on Radiologic Protection. This model allowed estimation of absolute risks of secondary cancer for each treatment plan based on dose-volume distributions for the nontarget organs. RESULTS: Proton beams reduced the expected incidence of radiation-induced secondary cancers for the RMS patient by a factor of >or=2 and for the medulloblastoma case by a factor of 8 to 15 when compared with either IM or conventional X-ray plans. CONCLUSIONS: The potential for a significant reduction in secondary cancers with pediatric cancers after using proton beams (forward planned or IM) in the treatment of RMS and MBD in children and adolescents represents an additional argument supporting the development of proton therapy for most radiotherapy indications in pediatric oncology

The patients have been attended to at the Medical Radiation Institute of Tubingen between 1977 and 1982. In 95 cases sole radiation was performed as operation was impossible. The other patients underwent a combined surgical-radiotherapeutical treatment. The joint doses of radiation applied ran from 50 to 70 Gy in five to seven weeks' time. In particular we considered the total survival rate according to tumor stage, the local tumor control and the period until relapse. 22% of the primarily irradiated patients achieved complete remission, 42% reached particular remission and 15% achieved minimal tumor remission (total response rate: 79%). Merely in 8% of the cases the tumor did not respond perceptibly. In the other cases irradiation had to be interrupted because of general worsening, or the patients got lost to post-therapeutical observation. The total survival rates, all stages taken into account, arose as follows: one year: 36.8%, two years: 12.6%, five years: 7.3%. After sole radiotherapy in 67% of the cases which had a radiologically verified relapse more than six months passed by before a local recurrence tumor was stated. The bad prognosis of the esophagus carcinoma, as demonstrated in literature, is entirely confirmed-the negative selection of our patients taken into account. The high rank of radiotherapy in achieving effective palliation is emphasized

Perforated intestines as a late morbidity after carbon ion radiotherapy for uterine cancers were examined to reveal the biological characteristics of carbon ion for future applications for the treatment of gastrointestinal cancers. METHODS: Between June 1995 and December 2004, 94 patients with carcinoma of the uterine cervix or corpus were treated with carbon ion therapy. Among them, 9 patients (9.6%) developed major late gastrointestinal (GI) complications. Four out of 9 patients had intestinal perforations excised operatively at our institute. The postoperative clinical courses and histopathological findings of the excised intestine were investigated. RESULTS: Carbon ion irradiation severely damaged smooth muscle layers by coagulation necrosis as well as atrophy of the intestinal epithelium and middle-sized arterial thromboses of the intestines. After evaluating late complications, the dose constraints on the GI tracts were set under 60 GyE to prevent major complications. Thereafter, the incidence of major GI complications markedly decreased. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrated the characteristic histopathological effects of carbon ion radiotherapy and thus are expected to facilitate future additional applications of carbon ion radiotherapy for the treatment of gastrointestinal cancers	
0	989	Comparison of different external beam treatment techniques to deliver high-dose irradiation to local recurrent rectal carcinoma	Aged, Carcinoma/pa [Pathology], Carcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Female, Humans, Italy, Male, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/pa [Pathology], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/rt [Radiotherapy], Prone Position, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Rectal Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Rectal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Treatment Outcome	AIMS AND BACKGROUND: Treatment of local-regional recurrent rectal carcinoma is a challenging problem, and local control may be dose dependent; doses should probably exceed 60 Gy. Our aim was to verify the possibility to deliver 66 Gy to the target, but less than 35 Gy to the small bowel, comparing different 3D irradiation techniques, in a selected group of patients. METHODS: Five patients with local recurrent rectal carcinoma were selected as representative of different presentations of the disease. Gross tumor volume and clinical target volume were defined [by RS]. Tumors ranged between 182 and 540 cc, and small bowel volumes between 748 and 1050 cc. A three-field technique, coplanar multiple fields, noncoplanar fields and a proton beam were compared using dose volume histograms. A positive result was scored when > or = 90% of the target received the prescribed dose with no more than 5% of the small bowel receiving more than 35 Gy. Doses were escalated in steps of 2 Gy from 60 to 66 Gy. RESULTS: The number of plans fitting the constraints were 7/19, 11/19, 18/19 for doses of 66 Gy, 64 Gy and 62 Gy, respectively. The stage of the tumor did not seem to correlate with the possibility to homogeneously cover the target with the prescribed dose. CONCLUSIONS: Simple coplanar and complex coplanar techniques (up to six fields), positioning the patient in a prone position with dislocation of the bowel, seem to be the best solutions to treat almost all of the patients with doses of 64 Gy. Where higher doses are concerned, it is not possible to suggest a "standard" solution. More personalized techniques have to be tested to define the best option

Protons have favorable physical characteristics that yield dose distributions superior to those of photons in certain clinical situations. As of December 31, 1987, 1,678 patients had been treated. Of these, 110 had chordomas or low-grade chondrosarcomas of the base of skull. The first 68 patients have a minimum follow-up of 17 months. The median dose was 69 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE). (CGE is the dose in proton Gray multiplied by 1.1, which is the relative biological effectiveness for protons relative to 60Cobalt.) The actuarial 5-year local control rate is 82%, and the disease-free survival rate is 76%. Thirteen patients with meningiomas have been treated, following subtotal resection. The median dose was 59.4 CGE. With a median follow-up of 26 months, no patient has had tumor progression. In addition, nine patients with gliomas and 12 with craniopharyngiomas have been treated

Twenty-six patients treated for prostate cancer are excluded because of their short follow-up. Local failure developed in 13 of the 78 remaining patients (16.6%)--major complications developed in 4 patients (5.1%). Follow-up has been 1 year to 7 1/2 years; 60/78 patients have been followed for more than 2 years. All local recurrences and complications occurred before 18 months. The device consists of two acrylic cylinders, an acrylic template with an array of holes that serve as guides for trocars, and a cover plate. In use, the cylinders are placed in the vagina and/or rectum or both and then fastened to the template so that a fixed geometric relationship among the tumor volume, normal structures, and source placement is preserved throughout the course of the implantation. Appropriate computer programs have been developed to calculate the dose from these implants. The advantages of the system are (a) greater control of the placement of sources relative to the tumor volume and critical structures, as a result of the fixed geometry provided by the template and cylinders, and (b) improved dose-rate distributions obtained by means of computerized optimization of the source placement and strength during the planning phase. We conclude that the local control rate (83.4%) with low morbidity (5.1%) achieved with the combination of external beam irradiation and MUPIT applicator in these patients with locally advanced malignancies represents an improvement over previous published results with other applicators

Treatment consisted of pelvic and para-aortic irradiation at a daily dose of 180 to 200 rad per day, delivering 4000 to 6000 rad to the pelvis and 4000 to 5000 rad to the para-aortic nodes. One or two intracavitary insertions each delivered an additional 2000 to 3500 rad to point A. The three year actual disease free survival for the 12 patients with Stage I and II disease was 50%. All six survivors remain alive without evidence of disease for 41 to 93 months, with a mean and median follow-up of 65 months. All patients dying of disease did so within 26 months, all but one dying within one year. All patients with Stage III and IV are dead of disease. Pelvic disease was controlled in 11 of 12 patients with Stage I or II disease, and in one of the three patients with Stage III and IV disease. There was no clinical indication of failure in the PALN in any patient. Nine patients failed with disseminated disease. Three of 15 patients (20%) suffered serious treatment-related complications. Two of these were attributed to the pelvic irradiation, with one patient requiring a colostomy. Thus, complications resulting from the extended field irradiation were seen in only one patient (6.7%). There was no treatment related mortality. Extended field irradiation can lead to a 50% survival in patients with Stage I and II cervical carcinoma and PALN metastases, a survival comparable to that reported in patients with involved pelvic nodes

PATIENTS: Subjects with clinical stage I non-small cell lung cancer who were medically inoperable or refused surgery. INTERVENTIONS: All patients were treated with proton beam radiotherapy. The target included the gross tumor volume as seen on CT scan, with additional margin to allow for respiratory motion. A multibeam treatment plan was generated. Delivered treatment was 51 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE) in 10 fractions over 2 weeks to the initial 22 patients; the subsequent 46 patients received 60 CGE in 10 fractions over 2 weeks. RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients were analyzed for this report, with a median follow-up time of 30 months. No cases of symptomatic radiation pneumonitis or late esophageal or cardiac toxicity were seen. The 3-year local control and disease-specific survival rates were 74%, and 72%, respectively. There was significant improvement in local tumor control in T1 vs T2 tumors (87% vs 49%), with a trend toward improved survival. Cox regression analysis revealed that patients with higher performance status, female gender, and smaller tumor sizes had significantly improved survival. CONCLUSION: High-dose hypofractionated proton beam radiotherapy can be administered safely, with minimal toxicity, to patients with stage I lung cancer. Local tumor control appears to be improved when compared to historical results utilizing conventional radiotherapy, with a good expectation of disease-specific survival 3 years following treatment	
1	4748	Maximizing local tumor control and survival after proton beam radiotherapy of uveal melanoma	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, anatomy & histology, Ciliary Body, Eyelids, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Melanoma, Methods, Middle Aged, Mortality, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local, pathology, Patients, Probability, Proportional Hazards Models, Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Risk, Risk Factors, Safety, Sex Factors, surgery, Survival, Survival Rate, Switzerland, Tantalum, therapeutic use, Time, Time Factors, Uveal Neoplasms, Women	PURPOSE: This study reports local tumor control and survival after proton beam radiotherapy (PBRT) of uveal melanoma. It identifies the risk factors for local tumor-control failure and for ocular tumor-related death. It presents the improvements implemented to increase the rate of local tumor control, and compares the survival rate of patients with locally controlled tumors to those of patients who had to receive a second treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We have treated 2,435 uveal melanomas with PBRT between March 1984 and December 1998. Data were analyzed as of September 1999. Patients' age ranged from 9 to 89 years; there were 1,188 men and 1,247 women. The largest tumor diameter ranged from 4 to 26 mm, and tumor thickness from 0.9 to 15.6 mm. Median follow-up time was 40 months. RESULTS: Local tumor control probability at 5 years was improved from 90.6 +/- 1.7% for patients treated before 1988, to 96.3 +/- 0.6% for patients treated between 1989 and 1993, and became 98.9 +/- 0.6% for patients treated after 1993. Among 2,435 treated patients, 73 (3%) had to receive a second treatment because of tumor regrowth. Cause-specific survival at 10 years was calculated to 72.6 +/- 1.9% for patients with controlled tumors compared to 47.5 +/- 6.5% for those with recurrent tumors. CONCLUSION: Reduced safety margins, large ciliary body tumors, eyelids within the treatment field, inadequate positioning of tantalum clips, and male gender were identified to be the main factors impairing local tumor control. The improvement of local tumor control rate after 1993 is attributed to changes implemented in the treatment procedure. Our data strongly support that the rate of death by metastases is influenced by local tumor control failure: improvement of the local tumor control rate results in a better survival rate	
1	865	Overview of clinical experiences on carbon ion radiotherapy at NIRS	Carbon, Carbon/ae [Adverse Effects], Carbon/tu [Therapeutic Use], Colon, Dose Fractionation, Esophagus, Female, Head, Heavy Ions/ae [Adverse Effects], Heavy Ions/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Japan, Male, Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Photons, Prostate, Radiotherapy, Recurrence, Research, Time	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Carbon ion beams provide physical and biological advantages over photons. This study summarizes the experiences of carbon ion radiotherapy at the Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba (HIMAC) at the National Institute of Radiological Sciences. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between June 1994 and August 2003, a total of 1601 patients with various types of malignant tumors were enrolled in phase I/II dose-escalation studies and clinical phase II studies. All but malignant glioma patients received carbon ion radiotherapy alone with a fraction number and overall treatment time being fixed for each tumor site, given to one field per day and 3 or 4 days per week. In dose-escalation studies, the total dose was escalated by 5 or 10% increments to ensure a safe patient treatment and to determine appropriate dose levels. RESULTS: In the initial dose-escalation studies, severe late complications of the recto-sigmoid colon and esophagus were observed in those patients who received high dose levels for prostate, uterine cervix and esophageal cancer. Such adverse effects, however, did shortly disappear as a result of determining safe dose levels and because of improvements in the irradiation method. Carbon ion radiotherapy has shown improvement of outcome for tumor entities: (a) locally advanced head and neck tumors, in particular those with non-squamous cell histology including adenocarcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, and malignant melanoma; (b) early stage NSCLC and locally advanced NSCLC; (c) locally advanced bone and soft tissue sarcomas not suited for surgical resection; (d) locally advanced hepatocellular carcinomas; (e) locally advanced prostate carcinomas, in particular for high-risk patients; (f) chordoma and chondrosarcoma of the skull base and cervical spine, and (g) post-operative pelvic recurrence of rectal cancer. Treatment of malignant gliomas, pancreatic, uterine cervix, and esophageal cancer is being investigated within dose-escalation studies. There is a rationale for the use of short-course RT regimen due to the superior dose localization and the unique biological properties of high-LET beams. This has been proven in treatment of NSCLC and hepatoma, where the fraction number has been successfully reduced to 4-12 fractions delivered within 1-3 weeks. Even for other types of tumors including prostate cancer, bone/soft tissue sarcoma and head/neck tumors, it was equally possible to apply the therapy in much shorter treatment times as compared to conventional RT regimen. CONCLUSION: Carbon ion radiotherapy, due to its physical and biologic advantages over photons, has provided improved outcome in terms of minimized toxicity and high local control rates for locally advanced tumors and pathologically non-squamous cell type of tumors. Using carbon ion radiotherapy, hypofractionated radiotherapy with application of larger doses per fraction and a reduction of overall treatment times as compared to conventional radiotherapy was enabled

Olfactory neuroblastoma is a rare disease, and a standard treatment strategy has not been established. Radiation therapy for ONB is challenging because of the proximity of ONBs to critical organs. Proton-beam therapy can provide better dose distribution compared with X-ray irradiation because of its physical characteristics, and is deemed to be a feasible treatment modality. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A retrospective review was performed on 14 patients who underwent PBT for ONB as definitive treatment at the National Cancer Center Hospital East (Kashiwa, Chiba, Japan) from November 1999 to February 2005. A total dose of PBT was 65 cobalt Gray equivalents (Gy(E)), with 2.5-Gy(E) once-daily fractionations. RESULTS: The median follow-up period for surviving patients was 40 months. One patient died from disseminated disease. There were two persistent diseases, one of which was successfully salvaged with surgery. The 5-year overall survival rate was 93%, the 5-year local progression-free survival rate was 84%, and the 5-year relapse-free survival rate was 71%. Liquorrhea was observed in one patient with Kadish's stage C disease (widely destroying the skull base). Most patients experienced Grade 1 to 2 dermatitis in the acute phase. No other adverse events of Grade 3 or greater were observed according to the RTOG/EORTC acute and late morbidity scoring system. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results of PBT for ONB achieved excellent local control and survival outcomes without serious adverse effects. Proton-beam therapy is considered a safe and effective modality that warrants further study	
0	1791	Use of high-frequency ultrasound imaging to improve delineation of anterior uveal melanoma for proton irradiation	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Biophysics, Choroid Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Choroid Neoplasms/us [Ultrasonography], Ciliary Body, Female, Humans, Iris Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Iris Neoplasms/us [Ultrasonography], Light, Male, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Melanoma/su [Surgery], Melanoma/us [Ultrasonography], Middle Aged, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Sclera, Software, Sutures, Tantalum, Transillumination, Universities, Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Uveal Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Uveal Neoplasms/us [Ultrasonography]	The aim of this study was to evaluate high-frequency ultrasound imaging (HFUI) as an aid in localizing anterior margins of tumours of the eye for proton therapy. Proton irradiation of ocular melanoma requires an accurate assessment of all tumour margins. The tumour is marked surgically by suturing to the sclera four or five tantalum rings on the borders of the tumour defined by transillumination. In order to evaluate the clinical usefulness of high-frequency ultrasound imaging, four and five rings were surgically placed in a patient with an iris/ciliary body melanoma and in a patient with ciliochoroidal melanoma using transillumination to localize the tumour margins. Subsequently margins were verified by HFUI. In the first patient, the distances between the rings and the limbus were measured using calipers during surgery and were compared with HFUI measurements and measurements from planning software. The distances were comparable within 0.5 mm. In the second patient the treatment was planned in two different ways using EYEPLAN software. In the first scenario the shape of the tumour and its relation to the rings were obtained from the surgeon's mapping, the fundus drawing using a transilluminating point light source, and the HFUI. In the second scenario, the shape of the tumour was deduced from the ring positions only. It was observed that the maximum difference between the tumour edge as seen on high-frequency ultrasound images and the rings was 2.6 mm. The tumour volume was underestimated by 39% when tumour shape was obtained from ring positions only. During the past year we have utilized HFUI in 18 patients having tumours involving the anterior segment of the eye, among which four were treated with proton therapy. In conclusion, we believe that high-frequency ultrasound imaging provides additional information with respect to the location of tumour margins in ciliary body and anterior uveal melanoma. Occult extension of the tumour within the ciliary body or posterior iris may not be appreciated by transillumination alone

The symptoms may subside spontaneously, but often persist. Treatment is usually by local injection of a corticosteroid, orthopedic devices or other standard treatment. If these methods fail, X-ray treatment may be considered. The efficacy of radiotherapy of the calcaneal spur was evaluated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From April 1981 through December 1991, 18 patients with painful heel were irradiated mostly with the caesium or telecobalt unit, usually with a dose of 4 times 0.5 Gy. Among these patients, 12 could be followed up during a prolonged period on the basis of questionnaires. RESULTS: According to the categories of v. Pannewitz 17% of the patients were pain-free by the end of the treatment course, 22% showed marked improvement, 33% showed improvement and in 28% the pain was not influenced. Over an average of 41.5 months 58% of the patients reported freedom from pain. CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose radiotherapy appears to relieve the painful heel syndrome in a high proportion of patients. The overall treatment risk appears to be very small. The mechanism of low-dose radiotherapy is unknown

Improved survival has led to increased interest in late effects of treatment. The objective of this study was to review the results of treating orbital RMS with multidisciplinary treatment at Women's and Children's Hospital and Royal Adelaide Hospital with emphasis on late effects of treatment. A retrospective review was carried out of all patients with orbital RMS treated with multidisciplinary treatment including radiation therapy and chemotherapy in the two institutions between 1982 and 2002. A total of five patients (age range 5.5-12 years) satisfied the eligibility requirements. Late effects were significant and included facial bone hypoplasia, cataract formation and growth hormone deficiency. Overall survival was 80% (4/5) with mean follow up of 8 years (range 3-13 years). Given the high cure rates achieved, future treatments must aim to maintain the good results but to reduce the high incidence of late effects of treatment. Standardised rating of late toxicity, long-term follow-up clinics, and implementation of modern radiation techniques (3-D conformal radiotherapy, intensity modulated radiotherapy, proton therapy) for patients with orbital RMS are important to improving outcome

METHOD: Since 1991, four consecutive patients from our institution with this tumour have been referred for postoperative proton beam radiotherapy. RESULT: We have experienced an unusually high complication rate (50%) of delayed radiation optic neuropathy. This has resulted in profound, bilateral visual loss at 1 and 2 years postproton beam treatment. CONCLUSION: It has served as a reminder that proton beam therapy is not an innocuous treatment option and this devastating complication should be taken into account when discussing the management of clivus chordoma. We postulate whether the optic apparatus is particularly sensitive to proton vs photon damage

In this study we investigate the potential physical advantages of combined photon intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and raster-scanned carbon ion RT over photon IMRT alone. For a representative patient we generated a carbon ion RT plan and a photon IMRT plan. Additionally, combined plans consisting of both carbon ions and photon IMRT were calculated using ratios of 20:40 GyE, 30:30 GyE and 40:20 GyE. The best target coverage was obtained using carbon ions alone. Using a combination of photon IMRT and carbon ions, the target coverage was better than with photon IMRT alone. Due to the applied dose constraints, the sparing of the spinal cord was comparable for all plans. Using carbon ions alone, the non-target tissue volume irradiated to at least 30 GyE/50.4 GyE was reduced by 72%/84% compared to photon IMRT alone. These advantages were evident even with combined techniques. The actually delivered dose distribution is expected to be more dependent on patient misalignment with carbon ions compared with photon IMRT. A combination of carbon ions and photon IMRT might be preferable in order to profit by the physical advantages of carbon ions while ensuring a safe treatment

Even after complete surgical resection, local relapses are frequent. Postoperative radiotherapy is therefore usually indicated. Intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) is a new technique that helps creating dose distributions that conform closely to the target volume while maximally sparing the organs at risk. This results in the possibility of applying escalated doses to the target while still keeping the incidence of side effects low. What is especially appealing is the possibility of shaping the dose distribution within the target in such a way that areas with a presumably high tumor cell load receive increased doses, a concept which is best described by the term "integrated boost". We present the case of a patient with a sinunasal carcinoma and describe the implications of the clinical implementation of this technique

This is a preliminary assessment of treatment-related morbidity and tumor response. Sixteen patients with T1-T2b prostate cancer underwent proton beam therapy. Acute and late toxicity was scored according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria Grading System (version 2.0, April 1999) and to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group grading system, respectively. Local control was assessed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values. Although skin toxicity and bladder irritability were commonly observed, none of the patients developed grade III or IV toxicity. Of 9 patients in whom the primary lesion was detected by MRI, partial response and no change (NC) was observed in 6 (66.7%) and 3 (33.3%) patients, respectively. Four patients presented normal PSA value before treatment due to the previous endocrine therapy. However, the other 12 patients with elevated PSA value before treatment showed complete response. No patients showed PSA failure within the median follow-up period of 11.9 months. Although longer follow-up is necessary, minimum toxicity and good short-term clinical responses were observed following proton beam therapy in T1-T2 prostate cancer patients

Cranial chordomas arise adjacent to critical neural tissues within the notochordal remnants in the clivus, frequently compromising adequate surgical removal of the primary tumor and making difficult the delivery of an adequate dose of radiotherapy. The optimal dose and fractionation have not been established. METHODS. The results of radiation combined with surgery, radiation alone, and surgery alone were compared based on the cases of 159 patients reported in the literature. An analysis of the optimal biologically equivalent doses (BED) was performed using the linear-quadratic formula on 47 patients. RESULTS. Past techniques using conventional photon irradiation have shown no dose-response relationship. Survival is improved for patients undergoing surgery followed by radiotherapy. CONCLUSION. Combined surgery and postoperative radiation is preferable to radiotherapy or surgery alone for management of cranial chordoma. Newer radiotherapeutic approaches will allow increased dose delivery to the target volume without an anticipated increase in radiation morbidity. It is believed that this will increase tumor control. Recent results of studies using charged particle therapy in cranial chordoma suggest that this may be an alternative way to optimize radiotherapy. [References: 49]	
0	4663	Proton therapy of uveal melanomas: intercomparison of MRI-based and conventional treatment planning	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Berlin, Eye, Female, Germany, Humans, Lead, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Methods, Middle Aged, Patients, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Risk, Safety, Tantalum, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Treatment Outcome, Universities, Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Proton therapy for uveal melanoma provides high-conformal dose application to the target volume and, thus, an optimal saving of the organs at risk nearby. Treatment planning is done with the model-based treatment-planning system EYEPLAN. Tumor reconstruction is based only on a fundus composite, which often leads to an overestimation of the clinical target volume (CTV). The purpose was to exploit MRI on trial in a proton therapy-planning system by using the novel image-based treatment-planning system OCTOPUS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten patients with uveal melanomas received both a high-resolution planning CT and MRI of the eye. MR examinations were made with an eye coil. EYEPLAN requires eye geometry data for modeling, and tantalum marker clips for submillimeter positioning and additional information from ultrasound and 3-D imaging. By contrast, OCTOPUS provides the full integration of 3-D imaging (e. g., CT, MRI). CTVs were delineated in each slice. For all patients, CTVs (EYEPLAN vs. OCTOPUS) were compared intraindividually. RESULTS: OCTOPUS planning led to a mean reduction of the target volume by a factor of 1.7 (T1-weighted [T1w]) and 2.2 (T2w) without compromising safety. The corresponding field size could be scaled down on average by a factor of 1.2 (T1w) and 1.4 (T2w), respectively. CONCLUSION: Compared with the conventional EYEPLAN, MRI-based treatment planning of ocular tumors with OCTOPUS could be a powerful tool for reducing the CTV and, consequently, the treatment volume and the field size. This might be translated into a better patient compliance during treatment and a decreased late toxicity

Due to the anatomically challenging position of the lesion, a three-field technique was adopted in which fields incident through the lungs and heart, as well as beams directed directly at the spinal cord, could be avoided. A homogeneous target dose and sparing of the spinal cord was achieved through field patching and computer optimization of the 3D fluence of each field. Sensitivity of the resultant plan to delivery and calculational errors was determined through both the assessment of the potential effects of range and patient setup errors, and by the application of Monte Carlo dose calculation methods. Ionization chamber profile measurements and 2D dosimetry using a scintillator/CCD camera arrangement were performed to verify the calculated fields in water. Modeling of a 10% overshoot of proton range showed that the maximum dose to the spinal cord remained unchanged, but setup error analysis showed that dose homogeneity in the target volume could be sensitive to offsets in the AP direction. No significant difference between the MC and analytic dose calculations was found and the measured dosimetry for all fields was accurate to 3% for all measured points. Over the course of the treatment, a setup accuracy of +/-4 mm (2 s.d.) could be achieved, with a mean offset in the AP direction of 0.1 mm. Inhalation/exhalation CT scans indicated that organ motion in the region of the target volume was negligible. We conclude that 3D IMPT plans can be applied clinically and safely without modification to our existing delivery system. However, analysis of the calculated intensity matrices should be performed to assess the practicality, or otherwise, of the plan

Moderate to severe losses were noted in patients producing voice with all types of alaryngeal modalities: tracheoesophageal, esophageal, and electrolaryngeal. Voice and speech losses were related to the impaired motility and vibratory capability of the esophageal wall and mucosa, to fibrosis of the submandibular region and to trismus. Tracheoesophageal and esophageal voice was recovered some weeks after completion of irradiation. No voice losses were observed in alaryngeal speakers who did not undergo voice restoration until after irradiation. All irradiated patients also showed various degrees of dysphagia during the treatment

OBJECTIVE: To present the surgical technique of total spondylectomy for a chordoma of the C5 vertebral body. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Malignant bone tumors require wide resection. Wide resection by total en bloc spondylectomy is difficult or not feasible for malignant vertebral tumors of the cervical spine due to the peculiar anatomic complexity of this region, including the vertebral arteries and the neural structures. There are no previous reports of en bloc resection of cervical spine tumors with wide surgical margins. METHODS: Using staged posterior and anterior approaches, a total en bloc spondylectomy and spine arthrodesis was performed. En bloc excision of a C5 chordoma was achieved using a threadwire T-saw (Tomita and Kawahara, Kanazawa, Japan) with surgical margins free of tumor. The patient received postoperative adjuvant proton beam radiation therapy. RESULTS: The patient remains disease-free 9 years after the operation. CONCLUSION: Total en bloc spondylectomy with wide surgical margins is feasible for malignant bone tumors of the cervical spine

The pelvic lymph nodes received a total dose of 2 Gy X 25 by means of an anterior and posterior radiation field. The prostatic gland was irradiated by an additional booster dose of 2 Gy X 10 given to a perineal field. Twenty-four patients have relapsed after their prostatic radiotherapy, only three of them within the irradiated area. For the patients with T0-T2 tumors, the 5-year crude survival was 69%, whereas it was only 37% for patients with T3 tumors. Thirty-five patients developed intestinal (26 patients) and/or urogenital (23 patients) radiation side effects. In three patients a colostomy had to be performed owing to rectal stricture or fistula. The poor survival after radiotherapy in the present series is probably due to a high incidence of unrecognized pelvic lymph node metastases. In the future only prostatic cancer patients without pelvic lymph node spread will be considered candidates for definitive radiotherapy. An optimal radiation technique is mandatory in order to avoid major radiotherapy-induced toxicity	
0	2934	The experience with definitive irradiation of clinically limited squamous cell cancer of the trachea	Adult, Aged, Carcinoma,Squamous Cell/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Lung, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Tracheal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	Squamous cell cancer of the trachea is an uncommon malignancy infrequently cured by either surgery or irradiation. Failure to control the primary tumor has been the most common cause for death. Our experience in three patients with small squamous cell cancer of the trachea treated by definitive irradiation is encouraging. The primary tumor was controlled in each patient. Histologic confirmation of tumor sterilization was observed in two. One patient remains alive and well at 54 months; one patient developed an epidural metastases at 16 months and subsequently died; and the third patient developed a separate primary lung cancer at 48 months. Two patients developed significant radiation complications	
0	1010	Experience with conformal proton therapy for early prostate cancer	Aged, Humans, Japan, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Middle Aged, Prostate, Prostate-Specific Antigen, Prostate-Specific Antigen/bl [Blood], Prostatic Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy,Conformal, Treatment Outcome	A study was conducted to evaluate the use of proton beam therapy for the treatment of organ-confined prostate cancer. This is a preliminary assessment of treatment-related morbidity and tumor response. Sixteen patients with T1-T2b prostate cancer underwent proton beam therapy. Acute and late toxicity was scored according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria Grading System (version 2.0, April 1999) and to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group grading system, respectively. Local control was assessed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values. Although skin toxicity and bladder irritability were commonly observed, none of the patients developed grade III or IV toxicity. Of 9 patients in whom the primary lesion was detected by MRI, partial response and no change (NC) was observed in 6 (66.7%) and 3 (33.3%) patients, respectively. Four patients presented normal PSA value before treatment due to the previous endocrine therapy. However, the other 12 patients with elevated PSA value before treatment showed complete response. No patients showed PSA failure within the median follow-up period of 11.9 months. Although longer follow-up is necessary, minimum toxicity and good short-term clinical responses were observed following proton beam therapy in T1-T2 prostate cancer patients

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty-one patients received a second course of PBRT. The mean interval between the first and the second PBRT course was 50.2 months (range, 8-165 months). Most patients (87%) received 70 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE) for both courses. Visual acuity was 20/200 or better in 30 patients initially and in 22 patients at the second treatment. The mean follow-up time after the second treatment was 50 months (range, 6-164 months). RESULTS: At the time of the last follow-up, 20 patients were classified as having no evidence of disease, defined as tumor regression or an absence of tumor progression. Nine eyes (29%) were enucleated because of local recurrence (n = 5) or intractable pain (n = 4). The 5-year eye retention rate was 55% (95% confidence interval: 25.2-77.4). Six of the 22 patients who retained the eye (27%) had useful vision (20/200 or better). CONCLUSIONS: A second course of PBRT for recurrent uveal melanoma to total doses between 118 and 140 CGE was associated with a relatively good probability of local control and a low enucleation rate. Although most patients lost vision, the majority were able to retain the reirradiated eye. Further evaluation is needed to assess metastasis-free survival of additional proton irradiation vs. enucleation after local recurrence

Preliminary results	Aged, Angiography, Choroid Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Choroid Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Epithelium, Evaluation Studies as Topic, Female, Fluorescein Angiography, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Melanoma, Melanoma/mo [Mortality], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Particle Accelerators, Phosphorus, Prognosis, Radiation Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Research, Television, Time, Ultrasonography	Choroidal malignant melanomas in nine patients were treated with proton beam irradiation at the Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory, Cambridge, Mass. Each patient received five proton beam treatments in eight to ten days, totalling 4,730 to 8,570 rads at the tumor. No complications occurred during the treatment or follow-up period, which, at the time of this writing, ranges from one to 24 months, with an average of 12 months. No further growth of the tumor has been observed in any patient. Different signs of tumor regression have been noted. Resolution of the serous retinal detachments that accompanied some tumors is the earliest finding. Pigment changes over the surface of the tumor and adjacent pigment epithelium is a usual initial tumor response. Fluorescein angiography initially showed decreased leakage of dye; later, destruction of the tumor's vasculature and elimination of fluorescein leakage became evident. Only large choroidal vessels remained patient. Ultrasonography revealed decreased height of the tumors postirradiation, and the radioactive phosphorus (32P) uptake test, repeated in one patient, turned negative on postirradiation measurements

DESIGN: A prospective phase 2 clinical trial. SETTING: Loma Linda University Medical Center. PATIENTS: Subjects with clinical stage I non-small cell lung cancer who were medically inoperable or refused surgery. INTERVENTIONS: All patients were treated with proton beam radiotherapy. The target included the gross tumor volume as seen on CT scan, with additional margin to allow for respiratory motion. A multibeam treatment plan was generated. Delivered treatment was 51 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE) in 10 fractions over 2 weeks to the initial 22 patients; the subsequent 46 patients received 60 CGE in 10 fractions over 2 weeks. RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients were analyzed for this report, with a median follow-up time of 30 months. No cases of symptomatic radiation pneumonitis or late esophageal or cardiac toxicity were seen. The 3-year local control and disease-specific survival rates were 74%, and 72%, respectively. There was significant improvement in local tumor control in T1 vs T2 tumors (87% vs 49%), with a trend toward improved survival. Cox regression analysis revealed that patients with higher performance status, female gender, and smaller tumor sizes had significantly improved survival. CONCLUSION: High-dose hypofractionated proton beam radiotherapy can be administered safely, with minimal toxicity, to patients with stage I lung cancer. Local tumor control appears to be improved when compared to historical results utilizing conventional radiotherapy, with a good expectation of disease-specific survival 3 years following treatment	
0	1939	Fractionated, three-dimensional, planning-assisted proton-radiation therapy for orbital rhabdomyosarcoma: a novel technique	Biopsy, Boston, Child, Cobalt, Dose Fractionation, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Hypothalamus, Male, Massachusetts, Optic Chiasm, Orbit, Orbit/ra [Radiography], Orbital Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Orbital Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Rhabdomyosarcoma/ra [Radiography], Rhabdomyosarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Risk, Survivors, Temporal Lobe, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Treatment Outcome, Visual Acuity	PURPOSE: Most children with orbital rhabdomyosarcoma will survive their disease. However, conventional photon-radiation treatment, as part of multimodality therapy, results in varying degrees of long-term functional and cosmetic side effects. This report introduces external beam proton radiation therapy (PRT) as a conformal, three-dimensional planned radiation technique for this disease, analyzes normal tissue dosimetry, and describes the technique's application in the first 2 patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between January 1995 and February 1996, 2 patients underwent PRT following biopsy and chemotherapy for orbital rhabdomyosarcoma. Fifty and 55 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE) were delivered to the gross tumor volume and 40 CGE to clinical target volumes in both patients. A relative biologic effectiveness (RBE) of 1.1 was utilized to correlate proton dose calculations with CGE. To achieve dose conformity, a "patch technique" was utilized, where target regions were divided into segments, each treated by a separate proton field. Dose-volume histograms were obtained for target and nontarget regions, including lens, bony orbit, pituitary gland, optic chiasm, optic nerves, lacrimal gland, and ipsilateral frontal and temporal lobes. RESULTS: At 3.4 and 2.5 years after PRT, both patients are clinically and radiographically free of disease. Visual acuity remains excellent, without signs of cataract formation; pituitary function is normal; cosmetically, only mild enophthalmos is noticeable. Doses to 90%, 50%, and 5% of lens volume were kept at less than 1%, less than 2%, and less than 8%, respectively. Fifty percent of lacrimal gland volume received less than 36% of the prescribed dose and 50% of the volume of the optic chiasm, pituitary gland, and hypothalamus were restricted to less than 2%. Proton conformity to orbital contents resulted in between 9% and 36% of the prescribed dose reaching the ipsilateral temporal and frontal lobes immediately adjacent to bony orbit (5% volume). CONCLUSION: PRT can offer excellent sparing of lens and selected intraorbital and ocular normal structures, while maintaining conformal target-dose coverage. The steep dose gradient beyond the orbit minimizes irradiation of normal brain parenchyma, with almost complete sparing of the pituitary gland. Reduction of integral irradiation exposure of the periorbital region will, hopefully, reduce the risk of second malignancy later in life. Reduced radiation dose to specific organs in close proximity to, but not part of the target region promises improved functional outcome and better cosmesis for childhood cancer survivors	
1	2497	Focal therapy for prostate cancer 1996: maximizing outcome. [Review] [64 refs]	Androgen Antagonists/tu [Therapeutic Use], Biopsy, California, Californium, Cryosurgery, Forecasting, Humans, Male, Methods, Patient Selection, Prostate, Prostate-Specific Antigen, Prostatectomy, Prostatic Neoplasms/th [Therapy], Radiation, Treatment Outcome, Universities	OBJECTIVES: To summarize improvements in patient selection and the results of focal therapy for the management of localized prostate cancer. METHODS: A contemporary series of patients managed with wide surgical excision, radiation therapy (three-dimensional conformal radiation, interstitial radiation, and charged-particle or proton therapy), and cryo-therapy were reviewed. RESULTS: We used preoperative cancer grade, transrectal ultrasound, and serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in all patients, and cross-sectional imaging and bone scans in selected patients to allow for reasonably accurate cancer staging and selection of patients most likely to be cured by radical prostatectomy or radiation. In patients with extracapsular extension of prostate cancer, wide surgical excision and achievement of a clear surgical margin had therapeutic value. Newer radiation techniques resulted in a higher likelihood of prostate cancer control than previous techniques. Cryotherapy for patients with stages T1 through 3 prostate cancer was associated with a posttreatment undetectable PSA rate of 48% and a positive biopsy rate of 23%. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with organ-confined and, therefore, curable prostate cancer can be identified. Well-performed radical prostatectomy, radiation, and cryotherapy are alternative treatments for the management of localized prostate cancer. [References: 64]	
1	683	Comparison of conventional-dose vs high-dose conformal radiation therapy in clinically localized adenocarcinoma of the prostate: a randomized controlled trial.[see comment]	Adenocarcinoma/bl [Blood], Adenocarcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Aged, Humans, Male, Massachusetts, Middle Aged, Prostate, Prostate-Specific Antigen/bl [Blood], Prostatic Neoplasms/bl [Blood], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Conformal, Recurrence, Research, Risk, Survival Rate	CONTEXT: Clinically localized prostate cancer is very prevalent among US men, but recurrence after treatment with conventional radiation therapy is common. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the hypothesis that increasing the radiation dose delivered to men with clinically localized prostate cancer improves disease outcome. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Randomized controlled trial of 393 patients with stage T1b through T2b prostate cancer and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels less than 15 ng/mL randomized between January 1996 and December 1999 and treated at 2 US academic institutions. Median age was 67 years and median PSA level was 6.3 ng/mL. Median follow-up was 5.5 (range, 1.2-8.2) years. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomized to receive external beam radiation to a total dose of either 70.2 Gy (conventional dose) or 79.2 Gy (high dose). This was delivered using a combination of conformal photon and proton beams. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Increasing PSA level (ie, biochemical failure) 5 years after treatment. RESULTS: The proportions of men free from biochemical failure at 5 years were 61.4% (95% confidence interval, 54.6%-68.3%) for conventional-dose and 80.4% (95% confidence interval, 74.7%-86.1%) for high-dose therapy (P<.001), a 49% reduction in the risk of failure. The advantage to high-dose therapy was observed in both the low-risk and the higher-risk subgroups (risk reduction, 51% [P<.001] and 44% [P = .03], respectively). There has been no significant difference in overall survival rates between the treatment groups. Only 1% of patients receiving conventional-dose and 2% receiving high-dose radiation experienced acute urinary or rectal morbidity of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) grade 3 or greater. So far, only 2% and 1%, respectively, have experienced late morbidity of RTOG grade 3 or greater. CONCLUSIONS: Men with clinically localized prostate cancer have a lower risk of biochemical failure if they receive high-dose rather than conventional-dose conformal radiation. This advantage was achieved without any associated increase in RTOG grade 3 acute or late urinary or rectal morbidity

Excluding 5 patients with malignant lymphoma, there were 23 patients with local disease and 10 with distant metastases. Doses ranged from 3,500 to 7,000 rads (35-70 Gy) among the 23 with local disease; local tumor control was achieved in 8. Six are alive and well 2-11 years later. External beam irradiation should be considered in locally advanced, incompletely resected, recurrent and metastatic thyroid malignancies of all histological types without 1-131 uptake. Reviewed are the age and sex distribution, histology, stage, extent of surgery, and dose and radiotherapy technique as they affect survival and patterns of failure

The initial 30 patients were treated with proton beams; the subsequent 810 patients were treated with helium ion beams. In the great majority of the 475 patients treated for pituitary tumors, marked and sustained biochemical and clinical improvement was observed. Variable degrees of hypopituitarism developed in about one-third of patients treated solely with radiosurgery. In the earlier years of the program, 365 patients underwent radiosurgery to treat selected systemic diseases by inducing hypopituitarism. Focal temporal lobe necrosis and cranial nerve injury occurred in about 1% of patients who were treated with doses less than 230 Gy

[Czech]	Fibrosis, Humans, Lymphatic Metastasis, Male, Necrosis, Testicular Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Testicular Neoplasms/th [Therapy]	At the Urological Clinic in Hradec Kralove in 1975-1989 a total of 182 patients with germ cell tumours of the testis--nonseminomas were treated. Of these patients 37 were in stage III-IV (20%). In 27 (72.9%) initial chemotherapy was administered, since 1980 combined with cisplatinum, as outlined. In 20 patients also revision of retroperitoneal nodes (54%) was made, to 19 patients adjuvant chemotherapy was administered (5th and 6th cycle). In 12 patients irradiation was indicated (32.4%). Histological examination of the preparation removed from the retroperitoneum was implemented in 15 patients: in four a vital tumour was revealed, in two a mature teratoma and in nine fibrosis or necrosis of a metastatic tumour was found. In seven patient a relapse of the disease occurred, 14 patients survive for 1-15 years. Twenty-three patients died

METHODS: A 75-year-old Japanese man was diagnosed as having a choroidal melanoma after undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Positron emission tomography (PET) revealed a hot spot in the same location as the intraocular mass seen in MRI. Carbon ion radiotherapy was performed with a total dose of 77 Gy, and the hot spot seen by PET disappeared completely. At 15 months after carbon ion therapy, the eye had to be enucleated because of uncontrollable ocular hypertension. It was examined histologically in serial sections. RESULTS: A large tumor mass (15 x 12 mm) with high pigmentation was found in the vitreous space. Almost all tumor cells showed necrosis in every section. A small number of intact tumor cells were present at the periphery. The overlying retina did not show any necrosis, but showed mild to moderate gliosis. No intraretinal hemorrhage, lipid deposit, or protein exudate was apparent. CONCLUSIONS: Almost all tumor cells showed necrosis after radiotherapy with a carbon ion beam. However, the effect on the adjacent tissues was determined as minimal in histological analysis

METHOD: Since 1991, four consecutive patients from our institution with this tumour have been referred for postoperative proton beam radiotherapy. RESULT: We have experienced an unusually high complication rate (50%) of delayed radiation optic neuropathy. This has resulted in profound, bilateral visual loss at 1 and 2 years postproton beam treatment. CONCLUSION: It has served as a reminder that proton beam therapy is not an innocuous treatment option and this devastating complication should be taken into account when discussing the management of clivus chordoma. We postulate whether the optic apparatus is particularly sensitive to proton vs photon damage

DESIGN: Prospective phase I/II study. SETTING: University medical center. PATIENTS AND INTERVENTIONS: Ten patients with stage I-II non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and FEV(1) < or = 1.0 L were irradiated with protons to areas of gross disease only, using 51 cobalt gray equivalents (CGE) in 10 fractions (protocol 1). Fifteen patients with stage I-IIIA NSCLC and FEV(1) > 1.0 L received 45-Gy photon irradiation to the primary lung tumor and the mediastinum, plus a 28.8-CGE proton boost to the gross tumor volume (protocol 2). MEASUREMENTS: Pulmonary function was evaluated prior to treatment and 1 month, 3 months, and 6 to 12 months following irradiation. RESULTS: In patients receiving protocol 1, no significant changes in pulmonary function occurred. In patients receiving protocol 2, at 6 to 12 months, the diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide had declined from 61% of predicted to 45% of predicted (p < 0.05), total lung capacity had declined from 114% of predicted to 95% of predicted (p < 0.05), and residual volume had declined from 160% of predicted to 132% of predicted (p < 0.05). Airway resistance increased from 3.8 to 5.2 cm H(2)O/L/s (p < 0.05). No statistically significant changes occurred in vital capacity, FEV(1), or PaO(2). CONCLUSIONS: Our observations indicate that it is feasible to apply higher-than-conventional doses of radiation at a higher-than-conventional dose per fraction without excess pulmonary toxicity when conformal radiation techniques with protons are used

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between September 1998 and April 2002, 16 patients with histopathologically proven ACC and residual macroscopic tumor were treated with combined photon RT and a carbon ion boost to the macroscopic tumor. Median total tumor dose within the gross tumor volume (GTV) was 72 GyE. Photon radiation therapy (RT) consisted of fractionated stereotactic RT in 7 patients; 9 patients received stereotactic intensity-modulated RT. Carbon ion boost was delivered by intensity-controlled raster scanning at the heavy ion synchrotron (SIS) at the Heavy Ion Research Center (GSI) in Darmstadt. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 12 months. Three patients developed locoregional recurrences 9, 11, and 24 months after RT, respectively. Actuarial local control rates were 80.8% and 64.6% at 1 and 3 years, respectively. Overall survival rates were 100% and 83.3% at 1 and 3 years, respectively. Acute side effects greater than Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) Grade 2 were observed in 2 patients; no patient developed late effects > CTC Grade 2. CONCLUSIONS: Combined photon and carbon ion RT is feasible and effective in patients with locally advanced ACC. Acute and late toxicity is moderate with respect to the delivered tumor doses and in accordance with the radiobiologic modeling. A Phase III trial is designed

However, the survival of severe cirrhotic patients has recently improved due to advanced treatments. The aim of this study was to define the role of proton beam therapy for HCC patients with severe cirrhosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 19 HCC patients with Child-Pugh class C cirrhosis received proton beam therapy. The hepatic tumors were solitary in 14 patients and multiple in five, and the tumor size was 25-80 mm (median 40 mm) in maximum diameter. No patient had regional lymph node or distant metastasis. Total doses of 50-84 Gy (median 72 Gy) in ten to 24 fractions (median 16) were delivered to the tumors. RESULTS: Of the 19 patients, six, eight and four died of cancer, liver failure and intercurrent diseases, respectively, during the follow-up period of 3-63 months (median 17 months) after treatment. A remaining patient was alive with no evidence of disease 33 months after treatment. All but one of irradiated tumors were controlled during the follow-up period. Ten patients had new intrahepatic tumors outside the irradiated volume. The overall and progression-free survival rates were 53% and 47% at 1 year, respectively, and 42% each at 2 years. Performance status and Child-Pugh score were significant prognostic factors for survival. Therapy-related toxicity of grade 3 or more was not observed. CONCLUSION: Proton beam therapy for HCC patients with severe cirrhosis was tolerable. It may improve survival for patients with relatively good general condition and liver function

Fifty-two out of 249 patients accepted for pion treatment by the end of 1986 were treated for malignant glioma with high dose pion irradiation. A substantial influence of their radioresistance was expected from increased radiation quality due to the contribution of high LET particles from pion capture, and by the possibility of target volume shaping and dose distribution related to the dynamic spot-scan conformation technique. The patients' treatment followed a dose escalation program with total doses from 2720-3420 cGy, fraction sizes from 170 to 205 cGy (90% isodose, minimum target dose), and treatment times from 4 to 5 weeks. 12/52 patients received an accelerated treatment with 3280 cGy in 14-22 days. 49/52 patients are eligible: 3 with astrocytoma of clinical aggressive behaviour, 14 with anaplastic astrocytoma (median age 42 years), and 32 patients with glioblastoma (median age 52 years). 8/49 patients had total/subtotal tumour resection, 19 patients a stereotactic biopsy. The patients were divided into three groups according to total dose, and a fourth group which received the accelerated treatment. There was no statistically significant difference in the median survival rate between the four groups, which was 13 months for the non-glioblastoma patients and 9 months for the glioblastoma patients. No radiation necrosis and no demyelination was found in 17 patients (6 recraniotomies, 11 autopsies). In 10/17 patients, clearly identifiable tumour cells were not demonstrated. NMR findings showed the tumour-surrounding oedema mostly stimulated by tumour necrosis and tumour progression. From these findings, further dose escalation programs, together with a shaping of the target volume close to the tumour, are not contraindicated

The patients had stage T1 N0 M0 to T4 N3 M0 disease. Patients with T1 N0 M0 disease (273) had an excellent long-term survival (90%) as did those with T2 N0 M0 disease (142), whose 5-year survival was 70%. Patients with more advanced disease but no nodal spread did not respond as readily to radiotherapy; the 5-year survival was 40%. All patients were treated using a parallel pair set-up 6 X 6 cm lateral neck fields. A more aggressive radiotherapy regime to a larger tissue volume to include microscopic spread to lymph nodes may improve survival of locally advanced disease

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective, noncomparative, interventional, consecutive case series. A total of 2645 patients (2648 eyes) with uveal melanoma were treated between 1984 and 1999 with proton beam radiotherapy. Data were analyzed as of February 2001. Patients' age ranged from 9 to 90 years, 1284 were men, and 1361 were women. Largest tumor diameter ranged from 4 to 27.5 mm, and tumor height from 0.9 to 15.6 mm. Median follow-up time was 44 months. RESULTS: The overall eye retention rate at 5, 10, and 15 years after treatment was 88.9%, 86.2%, and 83.7%, respectively. In total, 218 eyes had to be enucleated. Enucleation was related to larger tumor size, mainly tumor height, proximity of posterior tumor margin to optic disc, male gender, high intraocular pressure, and large degree of retinal detachment at treatment time. After optimization of the treatment technique, the eye retention rate at 5 years was increased from 97.1% to 100% for small tumors, from 86.7% to 99.7% for medium, and from 71.1% to 89.5% for large tumors. CONCLUSIONS: The treatment technique as used today results in excellent eye retention rates, even in less favorable cases such as large tumors and tumors located close to the optic disc. The experience and a continuous quality control program allowed us to improve the 5-year eye retention rate for all tumor sizes. These findings demonstrate the positive impact of experience and quality control-based efforts for treatment technique optimization	
0	1010	Experience with conformal proton therapy for early prostate cancer	Aged, Humans, Japan, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Middle Aged, Prostate, Prostate-Specific Antigen, Prostate-Specific Antigen/bl [Blood], Prostatic Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy,Conformal, Treatment Outcome	A study was conducted to evaluate the use of proton beam therapy for the treatment of organ-confined prostate cancer. This is a preliminary assessment of treatment-related morbidity and tumor response. Sixteen patients with T1-T2b prostate cancer underwent proton beam therapy. Acute and late toxicity was scored according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria Grading System (version 2.0, April 1999) and to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group grading system, respectively. Local control was assessed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values. Although skin toxicity and bladder irritability were commonly observed, none of the patients developed grade III or IV toxicity. Of 9 patients in whom the primary lesion was detected by MRI, partial response and no change (NC) was observed in 6 (66.7%) and 3 (33.3%) patients, respectively. Four patients presented normal PSA value before treatment due to the previous endocrine therapy. However, the other 12 patients with elevated PSA value before treatment showed complete response. No patients showed PSA failure within the median follow-up period of 11.9 months. Although longer follow-up is necessary, minimum toxicity and good short-term clinical responses were observed following proton beam therapy in T1-T2 prostate cancer patients

METHODS AND MATERIALS: In 5 patients, comparative treatment planning was performed by comparing proton plans and related conventional, conformal, and IMRT photon plans. The evaluations analyzed dose-volume histogram findings of the target volumes and organs at risk (OARs, i.e., pituitary gland, optical pathway structures, brain, nontarget tissue). RESULTS: The mean and maximal doses, dose inhomogeneities, and conformity indexes for the planning target volumes were comparable for all techniques. Photon plans resulted in greater volumes of irradiated nontarget tissues at the 10-70% dose level compared with the corresponding proton plans. The volumes thereby increased by a factor of 1.3-3.1 for conventional, 1.1-3.8 for conformal, and 1.1-3.7 for IMRT. Compared with conventional techniques, conformal and IMRT photon treatment planning options similarly reduced the mean dose to the OARs. The use of protons further reduced the mean dose to the OARs by up to 65% and 62% compared with the conformal and IMRT technique, respectively. CONCLUSION: Compared with conventional treatment techniques, conformal RT and IMRT similarly enabled dose reductions to the OARs. Additional improvements were obtained using proton-based treatment planning modalities

The carbon-ion beams were accelerated with the Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba (HIMAC). Six primary cultures obtained by biopsy from 6 patients with carcinoma of the cervix were irradiated with two different mono-LET beams (LET = 13 keV/micrometer, 76 keV/micrometer) and 200kV X rays. Residual chromatin breaks were measured by counting the number of non-rejoining chromatin fragments detected by the premature chromosome condensation (PCC) technique after a 24 hour post-irradiation incubation period. The induction rate of residual chromatin breaks per cell per Gy was the highest for 76 keV/micrometer beams on all of the cells. Our results indicated that cell which was more sensitive to the cell killing was similarly more susceptible to induction of residual chromatin breaks. Furthermore there is a good correlation between these two end points in various cell lines and primary cultured cells. This suggests that the detection of residual chromatin breaks by the PCC technique may be useful as a predictive assay of tumor response to cancer radiotherapy	
1	2536	Five-year follow-up of helium ion therapy for uveal melanoma	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, California, Californium, Cataract/et [Etiology], Evaluation Studies as Topic, Eye, Eye Enucleation, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Glaucoma,Neovascular/et [Etiology], Helium, Helium/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Incidence, Male, Melanoma, Melanoma/co [Complications], Melanoma/pa [Pathology], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Melanoma/sc [Secondary], Middle Aged, Optic Nerve, Prognosis, Radioisotopes, Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Research, Time, Universities, Uveal Neoplasms/co [Complications], Uveal Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Visual Acuity	One hundred sixty-four patients with uveal melanoma were treated with helium ion irradiation prior to May 1984, and the data were analyzed in June 1989. Most uveal melanomas were large, with a mean tumor thickness of 6.5 mm; approximately 60% of the patients had tumors that extended anterior to the equator. A complete follow-up was obtained for all patients. One hundred twelve patients were alive at the time of this report; 18% of the patients developed clinical and laboratory evidence of metastases and eventually died of widespread tumor. Eighty-four percent of eyes were retained. Data were analyzed with a number of parametric and nonparametric techniques. Larger tumors and those located in close proximity to the optic nerve and fovea had a higher incidence of most complications, especially visual loss

Short-term effects at 2 months following treatment were studied in a further three patients. MRI abnormalities were observed in nine patients. No statistically significant differences between patients and controls (n = 17) were seen in any of the calculated 1H-MRS metabolite ratios, in any of the three patient groups. On multivariate logistic regression analysis there was a correlation between the choline/water ratio and a low IQ. It is concluded that any systematic radiation-induced changes in the 1H MRS metabolites must be below the detection threshold of this study	
1	1136	Results of carbon ion radiotherapy in 152 patients	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Carbon, Carbon/tu [Therapeutic Use], Carcinoma,Adenoid Cystic/rt [Radiotherapy], Chondrosarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Chordoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Germany, Heavy Ions/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Ions, Middle Aged, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Sacrococcygeal Region, Skull Base Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Spinal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	PURPOSE: This study summarizes the experience with raster scanned carbon ion radiation therapy (RT) at the Gesellschaft fur Schwerionenforschung (GSI), Darmstadt, Germany since 1997. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between December 1997 and December 2002, 152 patients were treated at GSI with carbon ion RT. Eighty-seven patients with chordomas and low-grade chondrosarcomas of the skull base received carbon ion RT alone (median dose 60 GyE); 21 patients with unfavorable adenoid cystic carcinomas and 17 patients with spinal (n = 9) and sacrococcygeal (n = 8) chordomas and chondrosarcomas were treated with combined photon and carbon ion RT. Twelve patients received reirradiation with carbon ions with or without photon RT for recurrent tumors. Furthermore, 15 patients with skull base tumors other than chordoma and low-grade chondrosarcoma were treated with carbon ions. RESULTS: Actuarial 3-year local control was 81% for chordomas, 100% for chondrosarcomas, and 62% for adenoid cystic carcinomas. Local control was obtained in 15/17 patients with spinal (8/9) and sacral (7/8) chordomas or chondrosarcomas and in 11/15 patients with skull base tumors other than chordomas and low-grade chondrosarcomas, respectively. Six of 12 patients who received reirradiation are still alive without signs of tumor progression. Common Toxicity Criteria Grade 4 or Grade 5 toxicity was not observed. CONCLUSION: Carbon ion therapy is safe with respect to toxicity and offers high local control rates for skull base tumors such as chordomas, low-grade chondrosarcomas, and unfavorable adenoid cystic carcinomas	
0	1915	[Double irradiation for macroscopic radioresistance or recurrence of melanomas of the posterior uvea: clinical, ballistic, therapeutic and prognostic aspects. Series of 19 cases among 462 patients]. [French]	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Brachytherapy, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Melanoma, Melanoma/di [Diagnosis], Melanoma/pa [Pathology], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Neoplasm Metastasis, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/di [Diagnosis], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/rt [Radiotherapy], Prognosis, Protons, Radiation, Radiation Tolerance, Radiotherapy, Recurrence, Reproducibility of Results, Retrospective Studies, Time Factors, Uveal Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Uveal Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	We describe two comparative series of patients treated with double-dose betaraysbrachytherapy (106 Ruthenium) between 1983 and 1994, and double-dose proton beam therapy between 1991 and 1996. The indications for double-dose irradiation with the same radio-element corresponded to "macroscopically abnormal" situations: immediate and prolonged radioresistance, recurrence or secondary radioresistance. Thirteen cases are called series 1 (Ruthenium) and 6 cases are called series 2 (protons). The series 1 allows a more reliable study as far as follow-up is higher (5.8 to 7.5 years) than in series 2 where the follow-up is shorter (13.6 to 29 months). Although double-dose irradiation was macroscopically efficient in 11 out of 13 cases in series 1, and in 3 out of 6 cases in series 2 (stabilization or decrease of tumour height measured before the second therapeutic session), 2 patients are deceased and 1 has a metastatic disease in the group "recurrence" of Ruthenium serie. Another one has also a metastatic disease in the group "recurrence" of protons series. Nevertheless double-dose radiotherapy allows a complementary decrease or stabilization of tumour height after a first session. It also decreases the indications for enucleation if there is no severe anatomic complications, when a tumour does not regress or recurs after a first session of radiations

The authors report the results of treatment of 10 patients, six with chordoma, three with chondrosarcoma, and one with a neurofibrosarcoma. Local control has been achieved for all patients (with, however, one marginal failure) with a follow-up period ranging from 2 months to 6 years. High doses of radiation, up to 76 Cobalt Gray Equivalents (CGE), have been delivered without significant morbidity. In particular, no neurological sequelae have been observed	
1	142	Temporal lobe (TL) damage following surgery and high-dose photon and proton irradiation in 96 patients affected by chordomas and chondrosarcomas of the base of the skull	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Child, Chondrosarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Chondrosarcoma/su [Surgery], Chordoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Chordoma/su [Surgery], Combined Modality Therapy, Female, Humans, Incidence, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/rt [Radiotherapy], Photons/ae [Adverse Effects], Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Prospective Studies, Protons, Protons/ae [Adverse Effects], Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation Injuries/et [Etiology], Radiation Injuries/pa [Pathology], Radiotherapy Dosage, Skull Base Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Skull Base Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Temporal Lobe/re [Radiation Effects]	PURPOSE: To determine the temporal lobe (TL) damage rate in 96 patients treated with high-dose proton and photon irradiation for chordomas and chondrosarcomas of the base of the skull. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The records of 96 consecutive patients treated at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory (HCL) between June 1984 and 1993, for chordomas and chondrosarcomas of the base of the skull were reviewed. All the patients had undergone some degree of resection of the tumor prior to radiation therapy. Seventy-five patients were classified as "primary tumors" and 21 as recurrent or regrowing tumors after one or more surgical procedures. All the patients were randomized to receive 66.6 or 72 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE) on a prospective dose-searching study by proton and photon irradiation (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group #85-26) with conventional fractionation (1.8 CGE/day, 5 fractions/week). All treatments were planned using the three-dimensional (3D) planning system developed at the Massachusetts General Hospital, and the dose was delivered using opposed lateral fields for the photon component and a noncoplanar isocentric technique for the proton component. Clinical symptoms of TL damage were classified into 4 grades. Computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were evaluated for white matter changes. Abnormalities associated with persistent or recurrent tumor were distinguished from radiation-induced changes. TLs were delineated on the original scans of the 10 patients with damage and those of a group of 33 patients with no clinical or MRI evidence of injury. Dose distributions were calculated and dose-volume histograms were obtained for these patients. RESULTS: Of the patients, 10 developed TL damage, with bilateral injury in 2 and unilateral injury in 8. The cumulative TL damage incidence at 2 and 5 years was 7.6 and 13.2%, respectively. The MRI areas suggestive of TL damage were always separated from the tumor bed. Symptoms were severe to moderate in 8 patients. Several baseline factors, tumor- or host-related, were analyzed to evaluate their predictivity for TL damage: age, gender, tumor site, histology, type of presentation, type and number of surgical procedures, primary tumor volume, prescribed dose, normal tissue involvement, and volume of TL receiving doses ranging between 10 and 50 CGE or more. Only gender, in a univariate analysis (log rank) was a significant predictor of damage (0.0155), with male patients being at significantly higher risk of TL injury. In a stepwise Cox regression that included gender as a variable, no other baseline variable improved the prediction of damage. CONCLUSIONS: The 2- and 5-year cumulative TL damage rates were 7.6 and 13.2%, respectively. Despite the different TL damage rates related to age, tumor volume, number of surgical procedures prior to radiation therapy, and prescribed doses to the tumor, only gender was a significant predictor of damage (p = 0.0155) using a univariate (log rank) test. Chordomas and chondrosarcomas of the base of the skull may represent an interesting model to evaluate the TL damage rates because of their extradural origin, displacing the white matter instead of infiltrating it as gliomas do, because of their longer local recurrence-free survival other than gliomas and other brain tumors and because of the high doses of irradiation delivered to the target volume to obtain local control	
0	3263	Current status of clinical pion radiotherapy	Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Elementary Particles, Humans, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Relative Biological Effectiveness, Research, Skin, Skin Diseases/et [Etiology], Skin/re [Radiation Effects], Time, X-Rays	An RBE for acute skin reaction to peak pions, for a specific fractionation scheme, has been established at 1.40-1.44. The time of development of acute skin reactions varied in 2 patients with 30 metastatic skin nodules treated with doses varying from 1,175 to 1,951 peak pions and 2,350 to 3,901 rads of 100 kVp x rays. The reactions reached their peak approximately one week apart at all dose levels with both forms of radiation. No untoward effects have been seen in epidermis or subcutaneous tissues as late as 169 days after the start of treatment. All nodules disappeared and have not returned 169 days after treatment. There is a strong suggestion that the response of thick tumors is sensitive to the proportion of high LET radiation deposited at various levels in the tumor

METHODS: Among 249 patients with proton irradiation for parapapillary choroidal melanoma, the authors identified 59 patients who had visual-field testing performed before treatment and at least 18 months after treatment. The visual fields, color fundus photographs, and charts were reviewed to determine the prevalence of radiation papillopathy and visual-field loss after treatment. RESULTS: Nineteen of the 59 patients reviewed (31%) received a clinical diagnosis of radiation papillopathy. Progressive visual-field loss, defined as enlargement of absolute scotoma of greater than [corrected] or equal to 30 degrees as compared with the pretreatment visual field, was noted in 67% of patients with radiation papillopathy and 73% of patients without papillopathy. In both groups, visual-field loss correlated with the area of the retina predicted to be exposed to irradiation in the majority of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Progressive visual-field loss is common after proton irradiation for parapapillary choroidal melanoma. However, the scotoma usually correlates with the area of the retina exposed to irradiation. The development of radiation papillopathy does not appear to be associated with additional visual-field defects in most cases
